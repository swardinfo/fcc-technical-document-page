                    <p>The purpose of this guide is to give you an idea of what C# is about and the tools it provides for writing a program. What this is not is a step by
                        step guide into computer programming. Whilst someone with no programming skills may get some benefit, this guide it is aimed at those who have
                        experience with other languages and want to see what C# has to offer.</p>
                    <p>So what do you need to know. Firstly, developing a program in almost any programming language will require some basic maths skills, such as,
                        logical thinking, basic algebra, knowing the difference between integers and floating-point numbers, etc. You should also know how to install and
                        upgrade software and operating systems on a computer, and have an internet connection. It would also be useful to know some of the basics of how a
                        computer works such as CPU's, memory, file systems, etc.</p>
                    <p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly is theory of mind, what the user maybe thinking when they use your program. This should be a constant
                        consideration as you create your program. For example, entering a letter in a program when a number is required may be invalid. But having an
                        error message popup with each wrong keystroke that then needs to be cancelled...  This sort of user interface, (<i>UI</i>), will quickly lead to
                        frustration and result in your program ending up in the trash.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this guide, numerous links are provided to provide pathways to related information.</p>
                    <!-- SECTION The C# language -->
                    <h3 id="The_C_sharp_language">The C# language</h3>
                    <p>A written language is a system for using a combination of words and symbols to provide a means of communicating abstract ideas between two
                        entities. A computer language allows you to take abstractions from ideas and turn them into concrete implementations that can be interpreted by a
                        computer. As a developer, unless you only ever write software for yourself, your job is as a kind of ghost writer who uses a computer language to
                        tell someone else's story.</p>
                    <p>C# is a high level computer language, created by Microsoft and now maintained by the .NET Foundation as part of .NET, for the purpose of developing
                        computer programs. A computer uses binary, the language of ones and zeros. To put it at its simplest, all a computer can do is, like a light
                        switch, turn things on or off, albeit at billions of times a second. For any person trying to write in ones and zeros, this soon becomes an
                        impossible task. A high level programming language is a type of shorthand that is human readable making it easier for a developer to read and
                        write code.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION The C# language -->
                    <!-- SECTION .NET -->
                    <h3 id="dot_NET">.NET</h3>
                    <p>.NET is an open-source, cross platform framework created by Microsoft, now maintained by the .NET Foundation and distributed under the MIT License.
                        It provides the <i>Common Language Runtime</i>(CLR) which will run our code and other services such as memory management, debugging, garbage
                        collection, etc, making our job of writing code easier. The phrase <i>during runtime</i>, is often used to refer to the time in which the code is
                        running.</p>
                    <p>.NET also provides a large quantity of pre written code we can use that provides many of the basic functions such as file I/O, network access,
                        collections, user interfaces, etc, so we don't have to write our own. Whenever a console, WinForms or WPF program is created the .NET is added to
                        the available frameworks by default and can be accessed through the System <a href="#Namespaces">namespace.</a></p>
                    <p> The .Net version used throughout this guide is 6.0 and the C# version is 10.0.</p>

                    <!-- SECTION Integrated Development Environment -->
                    <h3 id="Integrated_Development_Environment">Integrated Development Environment</h3>
                    <p>An Integrated Development Environment or <i>IDE</i> is a program that contains various tools that assist the developer to write, run and test a
                        program. The IDE used in this guide is
                        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Microsoft's Visual Studio 2022.</a>
                        While Visual Studio has many tools, the three most important are the:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <!-- project requirement -.main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total, not each -->
                        <li><a href="#Code_editor">Code editor</a></li>
                        <li>Compiler</li>
                        <li><a href="#Debugger_and_breakpoints">Debugger</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The <a href="#Code_editor">code editor</a>, like a word processor, provides many tools that help in writing code. These include indication of
                        <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax errors</a> shown with a <u class="error">red wavy underline</u> that may prevent the program from running, and
                        <a href="#Syntax_errors">warnings</a> shown with a <u class="warning">green wavy underline</u> that won't stop the program from running but should
                        be addressed. It also provides code auto completion, called IntelliSense in Visual Studio, that provides suggestions with documentation and
                        formatting tools that help keep the code consistent with coding conventions. The code editor also provides interactive help. After highlighting a
                        word or symbol in the code, pressing <b>F1</b> will open the <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference documentation</a> to the appropriate
                        page.</p>
                    <p>The compiler is used by C# to convert the code the developer writes into the language the computer requires and using it is known as building the
                        program. On completion, the compiler will report if the result was successful or produce a list of errors that must be corrected before the code
                        can be run.</p>
                    <p>The debugger aids the developer in finding errors in the code. Not every program will be written perfectly first time and the errors that prevent
                        it from functioning correctly are known as bugs. If all you could do were to write, compile and run the program, then you would not have much to
                        go on. The debugger allows you to step through the code one line at a time to find the problem. This is known as running the program with the
                        debugger attached.</p>
                    <p>At the time of this writing there are three versions of Visual Studio.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community</li>
                        <li>Professional</li>
                        <li>Enterprise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All examples in this document can be created and run on the community version, which can be downloaded and installed free for individual developers
                        for free or paid apps, from the
                        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Visual Studio</a> web page. Use by
                        organizations is subject to conditions which can be found though the Visual Studio web page.</p>
                    <p><em>Note 1:</em> <i>This guide assumes that Visual Studio has already been installed, updated and the default settings have not been
                        changed. In particular it is assumed that the color theme is set to 'Light'. This can be set in the Options dialog under <b>Environment</b> &gt;

                        <li>On the <span class="nowrap"><b>Configure your new project</b></span> page type <b>HelloWorld</b>

                    </ol>
                    <p>The main window of the IDE opens with <i>Solution Explorer</i> open on the right and the code editor on the left. The <i>Program.cs</i> code file
                        should be open in the code editor with the code as per the following example. Not shown here are the line numbers in the left column visible in
                        the code editor. These are not part of the program and are purely for reference.</p>
<!-- Warning, pre and code tags require html to be formatted here which makes it look like crap in the code editor! -->
<pre><code>// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
</code></pre>
                    <p>To run the program click on the <i>Start Debugging</i> button <span class="play-button"></span> in the toolbar or press <b>F5</b></p>
                    <p>The console, a <i>command window</i> in Windows, opens displaying the words <span class="nowrap"><b>'Hello World!'</b> .</span> Congratulations,
                        you have now created and run your first C# program. The remainder of the text tells you the program finished but the IDE has kept the console open
                        so that you can see the result. Press any key to close the console.</p>
                    <p>When you started debugging, the compiler built then ran the program with the debugger attached. The program runs or
                        <a href="#Program_execution">executes</a> all the instructions, known as <a href="#Code_Syntax">statements</a>, it finds within the code
                        file. As can be seen there are two lines of text in the example. The first is a comment as marked by the two forward slashes at the beginning of
                        the line. Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not form part of the running program. The second line,
                        <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>, is the only statement in the file. This tells the computer to write a line followed by a carriage
                        return to the command window. The text to be written is located within the round brackets <code>( )</code>, which in this case is
                        <span class="nowrap"><b>'Hello World!'</b></span>. As there are no further lines in our code before the closing brace <code>}</code>, the program
                        exits. At this point the window of a program would normally close but Visual Studio has an option to keep console windows open so that you can see
                        the results. This option is turned on by default.</p>
                    <p>The <b>Console App</b> template used in the example is new to Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.0 and can use
                        <a href="#Program_structure">top-level statements</a> which also hides some of the boiler plate code that is required by a C# program. The

                    <h3 id="Program_structure">Program structure</h3>
                    <p>A C# project may consist of multiple sources of code along with other resources such as media and text files which are then compiled to create an
                        <i>assembly</i>. This can be in the form of either a class library (.dll) which contains discrete units of code that can be individually used by
                        other projects or an executable (.exe) file that can be started and run directly. An application may consist of one or more of these.</p>
                    <p>In Visual Studio when a C# project is first created it creates a <i>Solution</i> that includes the project and other files required by the compiler
                        to build the assembly. These can be viewed in the <i>Solution Explorer</i> window which can be accessed via the <i>Solution Explorer</i> tab on
                        the right side of Visual Studio. If the tab is not visible, select <b>View</b> &gt; <b>Solution Explorer</b> in the main menu. The Solution
                        Explorer appears similar to that of tree view of the File Explorer. Under the Solution root node is listed each project and under these each of
                        the folders and files they contain. To a large extent, you can customize the folder and file locations to suit your own requirements. When the
                        compiler first builds a project, several other files are generated and then updated with each rebuild.</p>
                    <p>A C# source code file is a text file with the extension <i>.cs</i> and can be opened and edited in a code editor or even a basic text file editor.
                        A code editor is normally preferred as it can provide tools for displaying and formatting the code text with the correct program structure and
                        syntax. Whilst it is possible to create a program in which all code is contained in a single file, except for the simplest program, most consist
                        of multiple files in which the code from one will reference or be referenced from that in another. Most commonly a file will contain a single
                        <a href="#class">class.</a></p>
                    <p>The Visual Studio 2022 <i>Console App</i> template creates a project that allows the use of top-level statements. This removes some of the
                        <i>boiler plate</i> code required by a C# program and allows <a href="#Code_syntax">statements</a> to be entered directly into a file without it,
                        as demonstrated in the <a href="#Create_a_Hello_World_Project">Create a Hello World Project</a> example. The code is then implicitly generated
                        when the program is compiled and is inaccessible from the code editor. The example below shows how the code looks with the boiler plate code in
                        place with further details as to its meaning in the <a href="#Code_syntax">Code syntax</a> section. All executable programs must have an entry
                        point, which here is <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code>, which in most documentation is usually referred to just as the
                        <i>Main method</i>. There are several rules that it must follow but the main ones that are of concern are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There can only be entry point within a program</li>
                        <li>It must be a method with the name <code>Main</code></li>
                        <li>It must be marked with the <a href="#static">static</a> modifier</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When a file has no top level statements and an explicit Main method as shown in the example, the compiler will use it as the single entry point. If
                        the file also has any top level statements, then the explicitly entered Main method will be ignored and the compiler will produce a warning of
                        this. When top-level statements are present they are contained within the hidden Main method implicitly created by the compiler. All code
                        preceding the Main method in the example are either <a href="#Code_syntax">directives</a> or <a href="#Code_syntax">declarations</a> so don't
                        create an issue.</p>
                    <p>Top level statements were designed for simple applications and supposedly making it easier to teaching someone new to C# without having to see the
                        boiler plate code. Realistically however, the vast majority of code you work with won't contain them so they won't be explored in this guide. For
                        more information on entry point requirements and top level statements please see the
                        <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference documentation.</a></p>

                    <h3 id="Comments_and_Task_Lists">Comments and Task Lists</h3>
                    <p>Comments provide information to developers as to what the code does and can also aid in debugging.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates the use of comments.</p>
                    <p>A comment can be in two forms, single line comments that start with two forward slashes <code>//</code> and extend to the end of the line or
                        delimited comments that start with a slash followed by an asterisk <code>/*</code>, end with an asterisk followed by a forward slash
                        <code>*/</code> and which can span multiple lines. For technical reasons that won't be detailed here, it is preferred to use multiple single line
                        rather than delimited comments and the code editor has tools that assist with this. Whilst a comment can be placed at the end a statement as
                        shown, this is not recommended.</p>
                    <p>As comments are ignored by the compiler when building the program, a technique often applied when debugging code is to <i>commented out</i> suspect
                        <a href="#Code_syntax">statements.</a></p>
                    <p>To comment out multiple lines, first select all the lines by placing the cursor in front of the first statement, then drag the mouse diagonally
                        down to the end of the last statement. Then while pressing <b>Ctrl</b> press and release <b>k</b> then
                        <span class="nowrap">press <b>c</b> .</span> To uncomment, again with all lines selected, while pressing <b>Ctrl</b> press and release <b>k</b>
                        then <span class="nowrap">press <b>u</b></span></p>
                    <p>The comment, <code>// TODO: This comment will be added to the tasks list</code>, is interpreted by the code editor as a task to
                        be added to the Task List. There are four predefined task tokens, <code>HACK</code>, <code>TODO</code>, <code>UNDONE</code>,
                        <code>UnresolvedMergeConflict</code> and custom tokens can also be added. Task tokens are not case sensitive. To see the task list, select
                        <span class="nowrap"><b>View</b> &gt; <b>Task List</b></span> in the main menu.</p>
                    <p><i>Documentation comments</i> provide information that is displayed by IntelliSense when entering code and can be applied to
                        <a href="#User_defined_types">user defined types</a> or the <a href="#Members">members</a> they contain. They are similar to single line comments
                        but instead start with three forward slashes <code>///</code> and can contain XML tags that provide special meaning to IntelliSense. Visual Studio
                        provides a shortcut for entering them; place the cursor immediately above the type or member then enter 3 forward slashes <code>///</code> and a
                        template of documentation comments with the appropriate XML tags will be inserted. Comments can then be entered within each tag which usually
                        includes a summary for a type and for a member, the return type and <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">parameters</a> if
                        applicable. The <code>GetFullName</code> <a href="#Methods">method</a> at the end of the example illustrates how a typical block of documentation
                        comments appear. Additional XML tags and attributes can be entered such as <code>cref</code> as shown in the example. For more information on

                    <h3 id="Code_syntax">Code syntax</h3>
                    <p>C# consists of text and symbols, each of which tells the compiler how to convert our code into a program. The <i>syntax</i> is the set of rules that
                        governs how our code must be put together, i.e. which word or symbol goes where. Together these words and symbols are combined to form statements,
                        declarations and directives that are the instructions used to create a C# program.</p>
                    <p>First a quick look at the structure of the code which we'll go to into detail throughout this guide. In general, a program takes the form of a list
                        of instructions with one per line, though C# allows for an instruction to span multiple lines if required. C# also allows for multiple
                        instructions to be enclosed within a pair of braces <code>{ }</code> called a <i>code block</i>. A code
                        block can be empty or it can contain any combination of statements, declarations, directives, comments and other code blocks. Each instruction,
                        depending on its type, must be followed by either a code block, a semicolon <code>;</code> or a carriage return. The compiler ignores comments and
                        whitespace other than as separators for words and symbols.</p>
                    <p>A statement is the part of the code that becomes the instructions that tells the computer what to do. The program runs or
                        <a href="#Program_Execution">executes</a> statements as they appear, top to bottom, unless a statement redirects execution to another part of the
                        program. A declaration instructs the compiler to create a placeholder for an <a href="#Object">object</a> that is to exist and become part of the
                        program. In some cases, a declaration can also be a statement. Before an object can be used, if it is a
                        <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">value type</a> it must be initialized or if it is a
                        <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">reference type</a> it must be created, also known as being <i>instantiated</i>. A directive is
                        an instruction for the compiler that while not directly part of our program will affect how our program will be built and run.</p>
                    <p>There are varying conventions on how to format code. These don't affect how the program runs and are purely for human readability. One such
                        convention used throughout this guide is to place code blocks containing statements directly under the beginning of the statement they belong to
                        and indent everything within them. An empty code block may be placed on the same line after the statement. The IDE has tools to aid with code
                        formatting styles such as these.</p>
                    <p>The first example doesn't contain too much code and when run, simply opens the console and nothing more. There's still a lot going on here so let's
                        break it down.</p>
                    <p>The line <code>using System;</code> is a using directive and must always end with a <span class="nowrap">semicolon <code>;</code> .</span> The
                        first word <code>using</code> is a reserved word called a <i>keyword</i> in C#. <a href="#Keywords_and_Specifications">Keywords</a> are directly
                        used by the compiler as instructions. The next word <code>System</code> is an <i>identifier</i>. Identifiers are used to name types such as
                        <a href="#class">classes</a>, <a href="#interface">interfaces</a>, <a href="#struct">structs</a>, <a href="#record">records</a>,
                        <a href="#Anonymous_functions">delegates, </a> <a href="#Enumerators">enums</a>, <a href="#Tuple">tuples</a>, a type's
                        <a href="#Members">members</a>, as well as <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variables</a> and
                        <a href="#Namespaces">namespaces.</a></p> <p><em>Note:</em><i> As with many C# reference texts the words <b>name</b> and <b>identifier</b> are
                            used interchangeably throughout this guide.</i></p>
                    <p>The rules for identifiers are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifiers must begin with a letter or the <code>_</code> character</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can only contain letters, numbers or the <code>_</code> character</li>
                        <li>Identifiers shouldn't contain two or more consecutive <code>_</code> characters as these are reserved for
                            compiler generated identifiers</li>
                        <li>Identifiers are case sensitive</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can only be declared once within the same <a href="#Scope">scope</a></li>
                        <li>A keyword can't be used as an identifier</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By being case sensitive it is valid for two identifiers to differ by case only, e.g., <code><b>n</b>ame</code> and <code><b>N</b>ame</code> are two
                        different identifiers.</p>
                    <p>More recently, C# has introduced the discard variable which is used when the output of an <a href="#Expressions_and_Operators">expression</a> is
                        not required. This is an advanced subject that won't be discussed in this guide but is mentioned here for completeness. The identifier for the
                        discard variable is the <code>_</code> character by itself. Unlike other variables, multiple discard variable identifiers can be declared within
                        the same scope.</p>
                    <p><code>namespace SyntaxExample1</code> is a <a href="#namespace">namespace declaration.</a> Namespaces are used to organize types into logical
                        groups. The <a href="#using_and_importing_types">using directive</a> instructs the compiler to import a namespace and the types it contains.
                        Following the namespace declaration is an opening brace <code>{</code> which signifies the beginning of a code block and its closing brace
                        <code>}</code> is the last line in the example. All code blocks must have an opening and closing brace. Nested within this code block is a
                        <a href="#class">class</a> as declared by <code>public class Program</code> and its associated code block. The <code>public</code> keyword is an
                        <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier.</a></p>
                    <p>Nested within the class is a <a href="#Methods">method</a> declaration <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> and its code block. The
                        <code>static</code> keyword is a <a href="#static">modifier</a> keyword that modifies the behavior of another keyword that it adjoins and
                        <code>void</code> declares that the method does not return a value. Following the method's identifier <code>Main</code>,
                        <code>(string[] args)</code> defines a <a href="#string">string</a> type <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">parameter</a> with the
                        identifier <code>args</code> that is passed into the method. The <a href="#Index_operator">index operator</a> <code>[]</code> declares that the
                        parameter is an <a href="#Array">array</a> which can contain multiple values of the same type. A method can have multiple parameters in the form
                        of a comma separated list and a class can have multiple methods, known as <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">overloads</a>, that
                        have the same identifier but differ by the number and/or type of parameters.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the naming rules above, there are various naming conventions that can be followed and you are encouraged to research these.
                        Ultimately it is up to you or the company you work for to define these but of most importance is that you are consistent throughout your
                        applications. One note, avoid having a class with the same identifier as a namespace as this can lead to confusion and possible
                        <i>naming conflicts</i>.</p>
                    <p>There may also be situations where using a specific identifier may result in a naming conflict with an identifier of a built-in type. In
                        particular all types, even those you define yourself, are provided by .NET with a number of standard <a href="#Members">members.</a> Unless these
                        are specifically being <a href="#override">overridden</a> the identifiers, <code>Equals</code>, <code>GetHashCode</code>, <code>GetType</code> and
                        <code>ToString</code> should be avoided.</p>

                    <p>Visual Studio has a number of built-in <i>code snippets</i> that allows you to use shortcuts to enter frequently used code. One such snippet is for
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>Console.WriteLine();</code>.</span> To use the shortcut type <b>c</b> then <b>w</b> then press the <b>tab</b> key
                        twice. In addition to the in-built snippets, you can add your own. For more information on the built-in snippets and how to create a user snippet,

                    <p>Following are three further examples of single line statements showing how <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variables</a> can be
                        declared and assigned values.</p>
                    <p> The <code>while (true)</code> statement also called a <a href="#while_statement">while</a> loop, together with the braces and enclosed code form a
                        code block. No semicolon is required after the closing brace. Within the code block is an assignment statement, followed by a <code>break</code>
                        statement followed by another assignment statement. As the <a href="#break">break</a> statement causes the program to leave the while loop before
                        reaching the second assignment statement, it can't be executed and is known as unreachable code. This won't prevent the program from being built
                        or run but will result in a warning in the code editor and should be rectified.</p>
                    <p>Next are three <code>if</code> statements which are <a href="#Conditional_Statements">conditional statements.</a> Some statements like these allow
                        for a single statement known as an embedded statement, to be placed directly after it without the need for braces. The second <code>if</code>
                        statement followed directly by <code>k = 1;</code> demonstrate this. Together they form a compound statement so the first two <code>if</code>
                        statements here are equivalent. An embedded statement cannot be a declaration or labelled statement so the last <code>if</code> statement example
                        is invalid and uncommenting it results in a <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a></p>
                    <p>Two more warnings are present in the code. Variables <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are
                        assigned values but they are not used anywhere in the code which results in a warning for each. As such declarations and assignments
                        are common so are the warnings and as decisions change while the code is written, it is possible that orphan variables can be left scattered
                        throughout. It is important then that periodic reviews are made and unused code removed before such warnings become unmanageable. Note that while
                        variables <code>a</code> and <code>i</code> both appear in the if statements, <code>a</code> is used to test them so does not produce a warning
                        whereas <code>i</code> is only assigned a value.</p>
<pre><code>namespace CodeSyntaxExample2

    internal class Program

        static void Main(string[] args)

            // Single statement.
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

            // Single statements, declaring and assigning variables.
            bool a;
            a = true;
            int i = 0;
            int j = 0;


            // while statement with code block.
            while (true)
            {
                i = 1;
                break;
                // Unreachable code.
                j = 2;
            }

            // These two 'if' statements are equivalent.
            if (a)
            {
                i = 1;
            }

            if (a)
                i = 1; // Embedded statement.

            //if (a)
            //    var y = 1; // Syntax error, embedded statement cannot be a declaration.
        }
    }
}

// The example writes the following to the console
// Hello World!
</code></pre>
                    <p>The following example contains two <a href="#class">class</a> declarations within the CodeSyntaxExample3 namespace. The first is called MyClass
                        followed by Program. MyClass contains declarations for several <a href="#Members">members</a> including an empty
                        <a href="#Constructors">constructor</a>, an <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">int</a> type <a href="#Properties">property</a>
                        called Property, a <a href="#Methods">method</a> called Square and a second method called Cube that employs an
                        <a href="#The_lambda_and_expression-body_definition_operator">expression body.</a></p>
                    <p>The compiler ignores line breaks, tabs and whitespace, so a statement can span multiple lines as it's the semicolon that instructs the compiler
                        where the end of the statement is. In the Program class, the <code>Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");</code> statement has been rearranged to span
                        five lines but is still valid code. The result however is quite poor for human readability and coding format conventions should be followed to
                        avoid this. As with naming conventions it is up to you or the company you work for to define these but of most importance is that you are
                        consistent throughout your applications. For the remainder of this guide, <i>statement</i> will refer to a statement that ends with a semicolon,
                        even if that statement spans multiple lines.</p>
                    <p>Following is a verbatim <a href="#string">string</a> literal. Regular string literals such as "Hello World!" can't contain line breaks so C# has
                        verbatim string literals prefixed with an <code>@</code> symbol that can. The result here is that "Hello World!" is written on two lines in the
                        console.</p>
                    <p>The <code>new</code> keyword must be used to instantiate a <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">reference type.</a> When this occurs
                        the type's constructor is called to initialize the object that is created. Depending on the access level of a type's member, they can also be
                        initialized through an object initializer.</p>

                    <h3 id="Program_execution">Program execution</h3>
                    <p>When a <a href="#Code_syntax">statement</a> is run it is said to be executed. Normal program execution starts with the first and ends after the
                        last statement has been executed in the <a href="#Program_structure">Main method</a>
                        <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Code_syntax">code block.</a></span> Abnormal execution can result in the program exiting prematurely or becoming
                        unresponsive.</p>
                    <p>Within a code block, statements are executed from top to bottom. If the statement is a <a href="#Conditional_Statements">conditional statement</a>,
                        alternate paths will be introduced in which one will be chosen dependent on the condition for that path being true. If an
                        <a href="#Iteration_Statements">iterative statement</a>, the statements it contains will be repeatedly executed until a condition is met that
                        allows execution to <a href="#break">break</a> out of the loop. A statement can also pass execution on to another
                        <a href="#Methods">method</a> known as <i>calling</i> or <i>invoking</i>, with the statement known as a <i>method call</i> and the method that
                        contains it known as the <i>calling method</i> or simply the <i>caller</i>. The <i>invoked</i> or <i>called</i> method is said to be <i>nested</i>
                        within the caller. In normal circumstances, execution is returned to the method call through a return statement if the method returns a value or
                        if the called method returns <code>void</code>, a return statement or the end of the method is reached. Program execution can continually call and
                        be returned from methods until the last statement in the Main method has been executed where, assuming there have been no errors, the program
                        exits normally.</p>
                    <p>A method call is in the form of <code>instance.Method(parameters)</code> for an instance of a type and <code>TypeName.Method(parameters)</code>
                        for a <a href="#static">static</a> type. To call an instance method an object must first be instantiated from the type that contains it. All
                        <a href="">statements</a> in C# programs are executed with respect to a <a href="#Methods">method.</a> For example, a
                        <a href="#Properties">property</a> is a method with a special syntax and an <a href="#Events">event</a> merely calls a
                        <a href="#delegate">delegate</a> to a method that acts as the event handler.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="#dot_NET">CLR</a> handles method calls by using a <i>stack</i> which in this context is known as the
                        <span class="nowrap"><i>call stack</i>.</span> This can be thought of as a stack of paper where each sheet represents a method. When a method is
                        called it is placed on top, known as <i>pushed</i>, and its statements are executed until returned to the caller. The returning method is then
                        removed, known as <i>popped</i>, and execution resumes with the method call. In computer science a stack is implemented using a
                        <i>Last In First Out</i> memory structure or <span class="nowrap"><i>LIFO</i>.</span> How the return from a called method is treated depends on
                        whether the method returns a value and which of the following is encountered.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A return statement is executed.</li>
                        <li>The end of the method is reached.</li>
                        <li>An <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Exceptions">exception is thrown.</a></span></li>
                        <li>An Exit statement is executed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If a method returns a value, then a return statement must be present for all possible return paths. Reaching the end of the method without
                        encountering one will result in a syntax error and the program won't compile. Here the return statement takes the form of <code>return T</code>
                        where T is literal or <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variable</a> of the return type declared in the method's
                        <span class="nowrap"><a href="#Methods">header.</a></span> If a method does not return a value, i.e. the return type is <code>void</code>, then
                        execution will be returned to the caller when either a return statement or the end of the method is reached. In this case the method can contain
                        any number of return statements including none, with the return statement taking the form of <span class="nowrap"><code>return;</code>.</span></p>
                    <p>If an exception is thrown, further execution is halted and the methods are popped off the call stack until one containing a
                        <a href="#try-catch">catch block</a> to handle the exception is reached. If one is not found, the program will exit resulting in an unhandled
                        exception. If a call to an <code>Exit</code> method is encountered the program exits immediately without returning to the caller.
                        <code>Exit</code> can be used in a conditional statement that tests if the program has an error that has put it into a non-recoverable state. This
                        way, along with other code, <code>Exit</code> can allow for the program to exit gracefully. For a
                        <a href="#Create_a_Hello_World_Project">Console App</a> <code>Exit</code> is in the <code>Environment</code> <a href="#Namespaces">namespace</a> so
                        the <a href="#Namespaces">fully qualified</a> name is <span class="nowrap"><code>Environment.Exit</code>.</span></p>
                    <p>Without intervention a program will simply run its course and exit. To prevent this and allow for user input, a pattern often employed is to use an
                        infinite loop containing a conditional statement that upon detecting a specific character, breaks out of the loop then executes the remaining
                        statements as normal. Care must be taken however, because if the condition cannot be met, the loop cannot be broken and the program will become
                        unresponsive requiring the user to manually force the program to quit.</p>
                    <p>The Console type provides such a loop in the method <span class="nowrap"><code>Console.ReadLine</code>.</span> When executed, this method waits for
                        input from the user, writing each <a href="#character">character</a> to the console as it's typed. Depending on the operating system, when the
                        return key is pressed, this will produce a carriage return, new line or a combination of both. If any of these are encountered, execution is
                        returned to the caller with a <a href="#string">string</a> value containing the characters entered.</p>
                    <p>A computer has a finite amount of memory and if totally consumed this could result in the operating system crashing. As this could occur from too
                        many nested method calls, the CLR will protect the system by throwing a <span class="nowrap"><code>StackOverflowException</code>.</span> One
                        notable cause for this is a pattern called a recursive algorithm where a method calls itself. If no safeguards are put in place the stack is
                        filled with calls to the method until it overflows.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i> A <code>StackOverflowException</code> can't be caught in a try-catch so it is important that careful consideration be made when
                        utilizing such patterns.</i></p>

                    <p>To aid in debugging, the code editor highlights <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax errors</a> that prevent the program from compiling with a
                        <u class="error">red wavy underline</u>. It also provides <a href="#Syntax_errors">warnings</a> of code that won't prevent the program from
                        compiling but can cause issues during runtime and need to be addressed. These are highlighted with a <u class="warning">green wavy underline</u>.
                        Information on each error and warning can be found as an entry in the <i>Error List,</i> usually located at the bottom of the code editor. After
                        selecting an entry, you can display help information by either clicking the error number or pressing <b>F1</b>, which in most cases will be a help
                        page on the <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference documentation</a> website. Double clicking an entry or by selecting it and pressing
                        <b>Enter</b> will move the cursor to the associated statement, opening its containing code file if necessary. The error list also provides various
                        filters, sorting and search ability to narrow down specific entries. To view the error list, you may need to click on the  <b>Error List</b> tab

                    <p>Two solutions are presented for this warning, the first is to remove the statement and the second to suppress the warning. In this case it's
                        decided that neither are what will be required for the code that is yet to be written and that the real solution is to remove the
                        <code>return</code> statement. As you can see, whilst IntelliSense can provide a number of potentially useful solutions, it can't mind read your
                        intent so it is up to you to make the final decisions.</p>
                    <p>This leaves the last warning regarding the unused variable 'x'. Due to the necessity of assigning variables before they are used elsewhere in
                        code, warnings like these will be frequent and can be temporarily safely ignored as your program evolves. Then, as you complete the various
                        sections of code containing such variables, if such warnings persist you should access whether a <a href="#Logical_errors">logical error</a> has
                        been introduced or remove the variable if in the end it was not required.</p>

                    <p>Unlike computers, we humans make mistakes and as developers these can create problems, or <i>bugs,</i> that prevent our programs from operating
                        correctly. Debugging is the process of analyzing the program and removing such <a href="#Error_types">errors.</a> Visual Studio provides several
                        tools to help with this. Some of these are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#Code_editor">Code editor</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>While these tools can greatly assist by highlighting errors and even making suggestions as how to fix them, they cannot fix bugs automatically.
                        Ultimately it is up to you to understand what is happening and to choose the correct solution to each specific issue. This is a skill that can
                        only be learnt with continual practice.</p>
                    <p>Debugging follows a repeated pattern, "what do you expect the code to do?", run the code, "what did the code do?". The way this is achieved is by
                        writing small, well defined pieces of code to which a single assumption can be applied. The program is then run to determine if it met that
                        assumption and if not, appropriate corrections are applied until it does. This is then repeated for each piece of code that is added until the
                        program is completed.</p>

                    <h3 id="Debugger_and_breakpoints">Debugger and breakpoints</h3>
                    <p>When running a program, it may end unexpectedly without providing any information. Worse, it may run through to the end and exit normally but the
                        function it provides may not be as expected. The debugger provides extra information and allows you to step through the code one line at a time
                        allowing you to locate exactly where the code is going wrong. Breakpoints can be assigned to any line and can assist you by instructing the
                        debugger to pause or <i>break</i> at the line prior to executing it. From here you can step through the program and examine the current state of
                        the <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variables</a>, parameters and type members that are in <a href="#Scope">scope</a>.
                        Breakpoints and the current debugger state appear as icons in the left margin just to the left of the line numbers.</p>
                    <p>There are two ways a program can be configured when it is being built; <i>Debug</i> and <i>Release.</i> Debug configuration adds extra information
                        to the build, specifically for use by the debugger. The release configuration removes the debug information and optimizes the program for
                        performance, for when the program is deployed. Debug or release configurations can be selected from the <i>Solution Configurations</i> dropdown
                        list in the Visual Studio toolbar. There are also two ways in which to run the program in Visual Studio; <i>With the Debugger Attached</i> and
                        <i>Without the Debugger Attached</i>. To run a program in <i>Debug Mode</i> the program must be run, both with the debugger attached and with
                        debug configuration selected.</p>

                        <span class="nowrap"><i>Restart debugging</i>,</span> and <span class="nowrap"><i>Step into</i></span> functions.</p>
                    <p>With debug configuration selected, the debugger can be started in <i>debug mode</i> by clicking on the <span class="nowrap"><i>Start Debugging</i>
                        button <span class="play-button"></span></span> in the toolbar or by pressing <b>F5</b> In the example, press <b>F5</b> now. The debugger starts
                        and pauses or <i>breaks</i> the program at the statement <span class="nowrap"><code>var c = a / b</code>.</span> Next to it, a dialog is displayed
                        indicating that an <a href="#Exceptions">exception</a> has been <a href="#throw">thrown</a> with the name of the exception, in this case
                        DivideByZeroException, along with other information pertaining to it. When an exception is thrown or a breakpoint encountered, the debugger breaks
                        the program at the line in the code where this occurs, known as being in <i>break mode,</i> highlighting it in yellow and placing a
                        <span class="nowrap">yellow arrow
                            <span class="yellow-arrow-point">

                        in the left margin pointing to it. When the debugger is running or in break mode, the text to the right of the
                        <span class="nowrap">Start Debugging button <span class="play-button"></span>,</span> that normally displays the name of the project, will change
                        to <i>Continue.</i> Clicking it now or pressing <b>F5</b> will continue the program as normal if in break mode due to a breakpoint and stop the
                        program if an exception was thrown. If multiple breakpoints have been set, the debugger will break at each one it encounters. Also while running
                        or in break mode, a <span class="nowrap"><i>Stop Debugging</i> button <span class="stop-button"></span></span> will appear in the toolbar.
                        Clicking it or pressing <span class="nowrap"><b>Shift + F5</b></span> will stop the debugger. An alternative to stopping and starting the debugger
                        is to use the restart function by pressing <span class="nowrap"><b>Ctrl + Shift + F5.</b></span>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>When using the debugger, the program being tested may have been made the active window and you may need to click on the Visual

                    <p>If the statement is the true source of an exception, then it can be corrected and the program rerun. More often than not, the source of the
                        exception is elsewhere. For example, dividing a number by zero will result in a <i>DivideByZeroException,</i> but the place where the denominator
                        became zero may be prior to this point. To solve this, you can place a breakpoint prior to where you suspect this may be occurring, then by
                        stepping through one line at a time and inspecting each variable's value as it changes, you can determine the defective statement. To set a
                        breakpoint, you click in the left margin next to the required location and a <span class="nowrap">red dot <span class="red-dot"></span></span>
                        will appear indicating the breakpoint and the accompanying line of code will be highlighted in red. When the program is rerun, it will break at
                        the selected line with all code prior to the line having been executed but not the line itself. To remove a breakpoint, click on its
                        <span class="nowrap">red dot <span class="red-dot"></span></span>. An alternative way to add or remove a breakpoint is to place the cursor on the
                        required line of code and press <b>F9.</b></p>
                    <p>In the example, with the debugger still in break mode at the <span class="nowrap"><code>var c = a / b</code></span> statement, set a breakpoint
                        on it and restart the debugger. This time the program will break at the statement, highlighting it but having not yet executed it, no exception is
                        thrown. When the mouse is hovered over each of the variables <code>a,</code> <code>b,</code> and <code>c</code> in the statement, a popup dialog
                        is shown indicating their values which are 6, 0 and 0 respectively. As denominator <code>b</code> is 0, this is producing the exception. Stop the
                        debugger, close the console and change <code>var b = 0;</code> to <code>var b = 2;</code> in the code editor. Next, remove the breakpoint and set
                        a new on <code>Console.WriteLine($"c = {c}").</code> When the program is rerun <code>var c = a / b</code> is executed without an exception being
                        thrown and the program breaks at <span class="nowrap"><code>Console.WriteLine($"c = {c}").</code></span> Inspecting the variables <code>a,</code>
                        <code>b,</code> and <code>c,</code> show their values are now 6, 2 and 3. Also, by hovering over the
                        <a href="#Expressions_and_Operators">expression</a> <code>a / b,</code> we see its value is 3. To do this, you may need to move the mouse away
                        from the variables and then back over the division <code>/</code> <a href="#Expressions_and_Operators">operator</a>. There is also a parameter and
                        another variable that can be observed. The parameter <code>args</code> is passed in through
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>Main(string[] args),</code></span> which is a an <a href="#Array">array</a> of type <a href="#string">string</a> and
                        like a variable, its value can be observed by hovering over it. The popup dialog displays it to be <code>{string[0]}</code> which means that it is
                        a <code>string</code> array with zero elements. The other variable, <code>arr</code> is an array of type <code>int.</code> As the statement that
                        declares and assigns values to it has not yet been executed, observing it now shows its value to be null, the default value for an array. We'll
                        examine how its value changes after assignment, next in <a href="#Step_into">Step into</a>. When <b>F5</b> is next pressed, the program continues,
                        <span class="nowrap">'c = 3'</span> is written to the console and the program exits. Close the console.</p>
                    <p>There are various other options for inspecting values including the <a href="#Immediate_window">immediate</a>, <a href="#Locals_window">locals</a>

                    <p>Step into executes the program one line at a time. By pressing <b>F11,</b> the currently highlighted line will be executed and the program advanced
                        to the next line or if the current line is a <a href="#Program_execution">method call</a>, to the opening brace of the
                        <a href="#Program_execution">called method's</a> code block. The variables can then be rechecked and the program state evaluated. This process can
                        be repeated until either the problem is found, an exception is thrown or the program ends. If the program isn't running, pressing <b>F11</b> will
                        start the debugger and put the program into break mode at the opening brace of the <code>Main</code> method. By default, only your code is stepped
                        through but this can be changed in Visual Studio's options.</p>
                    <p>Using the now modified code in the example, press <b>F11</b> twice. This first starts the debugger with the program in break mode at the first
                        brace after <code>static void Main(string[] args),</code> then advances it to <code>var a = 6</code>. Checking the variables <code>a,</code>
                        <code>b,</code> and <code>c,</code> reveals their values to all be 0. This shows that even though the
                        <a href="#Variable_declaration_and_assignment">declaration and assignment</a> statements for these variables have yet to be executed, the compiler
                        has already looked at the code and having seen the <code>var</code> keyword, implicitly declared them to be of type <code>int</code> and assigned
                        them 0, being the default value for an <code>int</code>. Pressing <b>F11</b> twice more first executes <code>var a = 6</code> then
                        <code>var b = 2,</code> changing a and b's values to 6 and 2 respectively. As the program is now in break mode on <code>var c = a / b</code>,
                        again pressing <b>F11</b> twice first executes the statement assigning 3 to <code>c</code>, then executes
                        <code>Console.WriteLine($"c = {c}")</code> which writes <span class="nowrap">'c = 3'</span> to the console. At this point,
                        <code>int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }</code> has not yet been executed so the value of <code>arr</code> is still null. Press <b>F11</b> to step into
                        and execute the statement. Observing <code>arr</code> now shows its value has changed to <span class="nowrap">{int[4]}</span> indicating it is an
                        array of type <code>int</code> with 4 elements. Additionally, an arrow has appeared at the left side of the dialog. Hovering over this reveals a
                        list of the elements, which as an array is zero based, are numbered [0] to [3], and their values, 1 to 4. One more press of <b>F11</b> advances
                        the program to the end where it exits and the console can now be closed.</p>

                    <p>In the example, press <code>F11</code> which will <a href="#Controlling_the_debugger">start the debugger</a> and <a href="#Step_into">step into</a>
                        to the opening brace of the <code>Main</code> method. As program execution is within the <code>Main</code> method, the variables, parameters and
                        type members within the other methods can't be observed. Step through the code until you reach
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>if (b != 0)</code></span> in <code>Method1.</code> If you now attempt to observe all variables and parameters anywhere
                        in the code, only <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> produce a popup dialog indicating their current values of 4 and 2 respectively. Step through
                        to <span class="nowrap"><code>var c = a / b</code></span> and now <code>c</code> can also be observed as program execution has entered the code
                        block of <span class="nowrap"><code>if (b != 0).</code></span> The value of <code>c</code> which is 0, changes to 2 when stepping into to the next

                    <p>Step though until you get to <span class="nowrap"><code>MyClass myClass = new MyClass()</code></span> in <code>Method3</code> and only
                        <code>myClass</code> and its <a href="#Properties">property</a> <code>Number</code> can be observed. Examining these reveals that the value of

                        <span class="nowrap"><i>Run to cursor</i></span> and <span class="nowrap"><i>Run to</i></span>. These each provide different ways to execute
                        sections of code without having to step through individual lines, so that you can quickly get to locations of interest. Note though that when
                        using these, if a breakpoint is present, it will take priority and the program will break at the breakpoint.</p>
                     <!-- SECTION Step over -->
                     <h4 id="Step_over">Step over</h4>
                     <p><i>Step over</i> allows you to skip over methods. When you are at a method call, pressing <b>F10</b> will execute the statements it contains but
                        without stepping through them individually and the program is advanced to the line after the method call. Pressing <b>F10</b> on any statement,
                        other than a method call, will step into it. In the example, set an additional breakpoint on
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>var cube = y * y * y</code></span> and start the debugger. The program breaks at the first breakpoint and nothing has
                        been written to the console. Press <b>F10</b> to step over the method call to <code>PrintSquare</code>. The program advances to
                        <code>var b = 2</code> and looking at the console, we can see that 'The square of 4 is 16' has been written, indicating that the code within
                        <code>PrintSquare</code> was executed without stepping through it. Pressing <b>F10</b> twice more first advances to the <code>PrintCube</code>
                        method call then, instead of stepping over the method, the program breaks at the breakpoint within it. Pressing <b>F10</b> three more times
                        steps through the statements in the <code>PrintCube</code> method one at a time, writing 'The cube of 2 is 8' to the console, then returns to the

                        start the debugger so that the program in break mode at <span class="nowrap"><code>var cube = y * y * y</code></span>. At this point only
                        'The square of 4 is 16' has been written to the console. Press <span class="nowrap"><b>Shift + F11</b></span> The remaining statements are
                        executed without being stepped through, writing 'The cube of 2 is 8' to the console and program execution returns to the method call. Stop the

                    <p><i>Run to cursor</i> will execute all code, up to but not including, the line at the current cursor position in the code and is achieved by
                        pressing <span class="nowrap"><b>Ctrl + F10.</b></span> It doesn't matter where in the line of code the cursor is positioned and can be used
                        whether or not the program is already running and whether or not the program is in break mode. In the example, with the program stopped, place the
                        cursor anywhere on the <code>PrintSquare</code> method call and press <span class="nowrap"><b>Ctrl + F10.</b></span> The program runs and breaks
                        at the <code>PrintSquare</code> method call. As it has not yet been executed, nothing is written to the console but observing variable
                        <code>a</code> we can see its value has changed to 4. Now position the cursor on the <code>PrintCube</code> method call and again press
                        <span class="nowrap"><b>Ctrl + F10.</b></span> The program advances to the method call and 'The square of 4 is 16' is written to the console.
                        Place the cursor on <code>if (b != 0)</code> and press <span class="nowrap"><b>Ctrl + F10.</b></span> The program breaks at the breakpoint in the
                        PrintCube method. Again place the cursor on <code>if (b != 0)</code> and press <span class="nowrap"><b>Ctrl + F10.</b></span>
                        'The cube of 2 is 8' is written to the console and the program advances to the <code>if</code> statement. Place the cursor on the closing brace of
                        the <code>Main</code> method and press <span class="nowrap"><b>Ctrl + F10.</b></span> <span class="nowrap">'4 / 2 = 2'</span> is written to the

                    <!-- SECTION Run to -->
                    <h4 id="Run_to">Run to</h4>
                    <p><i>Run to</i> allows you to advance the program to a specific line of code, but unlike run to cursor, Run to is only available while the program is
                        running or in break mode. To use Run to, when the mouse is hovered over a line of code, the
                        <span class="nowrap">Run to button <span class="next-button"></span></span> will appear to the left. Clicking it will advance the program to that
                        point. In the example, press <b>F11</b> to start the debugger and place the program in break mode at the opening brace of the <code>Main</code>
                        method. With the mouse hovering over the <code>PrintCube</code> method call, click the
                        <span class="nowrap">Run to button <span class="next-button"></span></span> that appears to the left. The program advances to
                        <code>PrintCube</code>, with all code between it and the previous position executed without being stepped through, resulting in 'The square of 4
                        is 16' being written to the console. Hover over <code>if (b != 0)</code> and click the
                        <span class="nowrap">Run to button <span class="next-button"></span></span>. The program enters the <code>PrintCube</code> method and breaks at
                        the breakpoint. Now hover over the closing brace of the <code>Main</code> method and again click the
                        <span class="nowrap">Run to button <span class="next-button"></span></span>. The remaining code between the breakpoint and the end of the program
                        is executed resulting in both 'The cube of 2 is 8' and <span class="nowrap">'4 / 2 = 2'</span> being written to the console. Stop the debugger and

                    <p>Press <b>F11</b> twice to step through to <code>var square = x * x</code> in the <code>PrintSquare</code> method. As program execution has left the

                        <code>square</code> are listed.</p>

                    <p>Step through again so that the program is located at the closing brace of <code>PrintSquare.</code> 'The square of 4 is 16' has been written to the
                        console and the color of the <code>square</code> value has reverted back to black, indicating that it hasn't changed since last checked. Step
                        though until you get to <code>var c = a / b</code> and the following is listed.</p>
<pre><code> Name        Value           Type

                    <p>As program execution has now entered the local scope of the if statement code block, in addition to the variables that were initially listed at the
                        start of the exercise, variable <code>c</code> has also been included. Inspecting the locals window, the values for <code>a</code> and
                        <code>b</code> are 4 and 2 respectively and hovering over the expression <code>a / b</code> shows it equates to 2. As the statement has not been
                        executed, the value of <code>c</code> is 0. You can change the value of a variable in the locals window by double clicking on the value displayed,
                        then enter the new value. In the example, double click <code>a's</code> value in the locals window and change it to 16, then click away from it to
                        accept the change. Its color will change to red to indicate that it has changed since it was last checked and hovering over <code>a / b</code>
                        shows that the expression now equates to 8. Stepping into <code>var c = a / b</code> executes the statement, the value of <code>c</code> changes
                        to 8, its color to red and the color of <code>a</code> back to black. Stepping into the next statement writes '16 / 2 = 8' to the console and the
                        color of <code>c</code> changes back to black.</p>
                    <p>Stepping though to <code>myClass.Property1 = 10,</code> variable <code>c</code> is no longer listed as it is no longer in scope. Variables
                        <code>arr</code> and <code>myClass</code> have been assigned values, so these appear in the list and are {int[4]} and {LocalsWindows.MyClass}
                        respectively. As <code>arr</code> is an array with multiple elements and <code>myClass</code> is a class with multiple properties, each have an
                        arrow to the left that when clicked, expands the nodes in the locals window to reveal them. Step into <code>myClass.Property1 = 10</code> to
                        execute it. The value of <code>Property1</code> in the locals window changes from 0 to 10 and its color changes to red. Pressing <b>F11</b> once
                        more exits the program and the locals window closes. You can now close the console.</p>

                    <p>As the program code grows the likelihood that an error will be introduced grows with it. C# provides tools for handling these depending on the kind

                    <h3 id="Error_types">Error types</h3>
                    <p>There are three different kinds of errors, syntax errors, runtime errors and logical errors.</p>

                    <h4 id="Syntax_errors">Syntax errors</h4>
                    <p>As the title suggests, syntax errors occur when the <a href="#Code_syntax">syntax</a> is wrong and this will prevent the code from being
                        <a href="#Integrated_Development_Environment">compiled</a>. This could be caused by a
                        spelling mistake, a missing semi colon, an incorrect use of a language element, etc. These are the easiest errors to fix as the
                        <a href="#Code_editor">code editor</a>, much like a word processor, identifies such errors with a <u class="error">red wavy underline</u>. Syntax
                        errors are also sometimes called compile errors or compile-time errors. Additionally, the code editor will provide warnings with a
                        <u class="warning">green wavy underline</u>. Whilst these won't prevent the program from compiling, they indicate problems that most likely will
                        result in issues when the program is run and should be addressed. As well as highlighting errors and warnings, the code editor provides a number
                        of other tools to assist the developer in debugging.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates a syntax error.</p>
<pre><code>namespace SyntaxError
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The following results in the compiler error.

                    <h4 id="Runtime_errors">Runtime error</h4>
                    <p>A runtime error occurs after the program has been compiled and is running. Whilst syntactically correct, when the code is executed, it will result
                        in an error that can't be resolved and stops the program from functioning. The <a href="#dot_NET">CLR</a> then looks for the reason the error
                        occurred and reports it in the form of an <a href="#Exceptions">exception.</a> As such errors are at a fixed point in the code, these can usually
                        be fixed fairly easily by either correcting the error through <a href="#Debugging">debugging</a> or by providing appropriate
                        <a href="#try-catch">exception handling.</a> See <a href="#Exceptions">Exceptions</a> for an example of a runtime error.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Runtime errors -->
                    <!-- SECTION Logical errors -->
                    <h4 id="Logical_errors">Logical error</h4>
                    <p>These are errors that occur while the program is running but don't cause the program to crash. Instead, the program will produce an unexpected
                        result. For example, the sum of a list of numbers may be far more than expected because an expression may mistakenly multiply instead of adding
                        the values. These are often the hardest errors to debug as they most often they result from incorrect assumptions on what the program is doing
                        and could be buried deep within thousands or even millions of lines of code. As with runtime errors, a number of
                        <a href="#Debugging">debugging</a> techniques can be used to correct the issues.</p>
                    <p>The following is an example of a logical error. The numbers are multiplied when they should be added. The expected result from adding 3 + 5 is 7,
                        but the program produces 15, the result of multiplication.</p>
<pre><code>namespace LogicalErrors
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The literals are multiplied when they should be added
            Console.WriteLine($"3 + 5 = {3 * 5}");
        }
    }
}

// The example writes the following to the console
// 3 + 5 = 15

                    <p>When an error that is caused by and cannot be resolved by the current executing statement occurs, an exception is thrown. This could be due to code
                        in the CLR, a third-party library or the current application. At this point the CLR searches back up the stack until either exception handling, in
                        the form of a <a href="#try-catch">try-catch</a> statement is reached, or the program exits in which case the operating system may report the
                        program has exited with an unhandled exception. C# has a number of built-in exceptions that are thrown for various error conditions. You can also
                        create your own custom exceptions though the built-in types should be used where possible. Following is an example that shows the result of
                        attempting to divide by zero. By clicking on the <i>Start Debugging</i> button <span class="play-button"></span> in the toolbar or by pressing
                        <b>F5</b> the program will run with the debugger attached and then stop and highlight the statement
                        <code>var z = x / y;</code> and display an <i>Exception Unhandled</i> dialog box with the message <i>System.DivideByZeroException: 'Attempted to
                        divide by zero.'</i> of which <code>DivideByZeroException</code> is the exception. To stop the program and clear the exception click the
                        <i>Stop Debugging</i> <span class="stop-button"></span> button in the toolbar or press <span class="nowrap"><b>Shift + F5</b></span></p>

                    <p>Sometimes you may wish to check for invalid conditions specific to your own program. When these occur, you can respond by throwing an exception of
                    your own choice using the <code>throw</code> keyword. You can also include a custom message with the exception. The following throws an
                    <code>ArgumentException</code> with the message <i>y cannot be zero</i>.</p>
<pre><code>namespace Throw

</code></pre>
                    <p> As the name suggests, an exception should only be used for exceptional circumstances and should not be used to control program execution. Instead,
                        conditional statements should always be employed to look for potential errors.</p>

                    <h3 id="try-catch">try-catch</h3>
                    <p>The try-catch provides a mechanism to safely handle exceptions and consists of a <code>try</code> code block followed by a <code>catch</code>
                        code block. Code that has the possibility of resulting in an exception is placed within the <code>try</code> block and if an exception occurs
                        program execution stops before any further code within the <code>try</code> block is run. Program execution then passes to a catch block that
                        targets the exception. If none is found, program execution passes back to the calling code until an appropriate catch block is found. If a
                        <code>catch</code> block is not found then the program ends with an <i>unhandled exception</i></p>.
                    <p>Following shows how the <code>DivideByZeroException</code> in the previous example could be handled. When run, instead of resulting in an unhandled
                        exception dialog box, <i>'Attempted to divide by zero.'</i> is written to the console.</p>
<pre><code>namespace TryCatch
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = 1;
            int y = 0;
            try
            {
                int z = x / y;
            }
            catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}

// The example writes the following to the console
// Attempted to divide by zero.
</code></pre>
                    <p>It is important to note that catching exceptions should not be used just to control program flow. In the previous example an
                        <a href="#if_statement">if statement</a> could be used to test the value of <code>y</code> and only allow the division to take place if it is not
                        zero. An example of where a try-catch could be employed is writing to a file as is not possible to test prior whether the action will succeed.</p>

                    <p>It is possible to have multiple catch blocks so as to catch different exceptions. An exception is only caught by the first catch block that
                        can handle it. If there is the possibility that the exception could be caught by more than one, the catch blocks should be ordered most to least
                        specific. In the following example the first block catches the <code>DivideByZeroException</code> and the second <code>Exception</code>
                        catches all exceptions. This means that if <code>DivideByZeroException</code> code block had not been present then the divide by zero exception
                        would have been caught by the <code>Exception</code> code block.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Variables are used to represent data in memory using a symbolic name. Every variable has a <i>type</i> that determines what type of data can be
                        stored and a <i>value</i> which is the actual data. C# is a strongly typed language which means the variable's type must be declared before it can
                        be used and cannot be changed later. When an attempt is made to store a value in a variable the compiler will check if it is of the correct type
                        and if not, indicate this as a <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error</a> and prevent the program from being compiled. Storing a value is said to
                        be assigning a value and a variable that has been assigned a value is said to be initialized. A <i>constant</i> is similar to a variable, except
                        it must be initialized when it is declared and that value cannot be changed. A <i>literal</i> is the representation in code of the data that is
                        assigned to a variable. Variables and constants can only be declared once within the same <a href="#Scope">scope.</a> Throughout much of
                        <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference documentation</a>, generically types may be referred to with a single <code>T</code> and where
                        appropriate, the same will be done within this document.</p>
                    <p>C# has two basic categories of variables, the <i>value type</i> and the <i>reference type</i>, into which all variable types are grouped. A value
                        type stores its own data where as a reference type stores the address to where its data is located. You can think of these as a person and a
                        contact in an address book. The value type is like the person that has a name and physical body whereas the reference type is like the contact
                        that only stores the name of the person and the address to where they live.</p>
                    <p>C# has a number of built-in types within these two categories of which each has a dedicated <a href="#C_Sharp_Specifications">keyword</a> and you
                        can also create your own <a href="#User_defined_types">user defined types.</a></p>
                    <p>C# allocates memory based on the smallest size unit of an 8-bit byte. For efficiency reasons, each value type uses a fixed number of bytes. For an
                        integer, C# provides a number of options based on size and whether negative values are allowed. The most commonly used is the <i>int</i> which has
                        a memory allocation of 4 bytes, or 32 bits, and can have negative values. It has a range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. When you write
                        <code>int i = 1;</code> this declares an <code>int</code> type variable with the identifier <code>i</code> and assigns the value <code>1</code> to
                        it. In essence you are telling the compiler to reserve a 4-byte section of memory, that its address will be referred to by the variable with the
                        identifier <code>i</code> and to store the value <code>1</code> in it. But for a few exceptions, operations on one value type variable cannot
                        affect the data of another. A value type variable cannot be changed to refer to data in another memory location.</p>
                    <p>Providing it is of the same type a reference type can be changed to refer to a different location in memory and its size in memory can change. A
                        reference type can only refer to one location at a time but two reference type variables can refer to the same location. The result is that
                        changing the contents of one will affect the contents of the other.</p>
                    <p>Variables can be compared for equality and depending on the type, various <a href="#Equality_operators">equality operators</a> can be applied. When
                        two variables are compared, how value and reference types are evaluated differs. In most cases if the two are value types, then they will be equal
                        if the values they contain are the same, whereas two reference types will be the same if they both refer to the same location in memory. A notable
                        exception is the <a href="#record">record</a> which is a reference type with value type equality.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> Various type's <a href="#Members">members</a> allow the <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">passing in</a> of
                        variables as arguments. When this occurs, how the variable is affected depends on whether it is a value or reference type and whether any
                        <a href="#Modifiers">modifiers</a> have been applied.</i></p>
                    <!-- SECTION null -->
                    <h3 id="null">null</h3>
                    <p>In C#, when a reference type variable has been declared but does not refer to an object, its value will be <i>null</i>. Using the previous analogy,
                        this is like a contact in an address book which only has the person's name but without any address information. Within the context of nullability,
                        a type that can be assigned null is said to be nullable and one that isn't, non-nullable. A nullable type can also be assigned null through use of
                        the <code>null</code> keyword. If an attempt is made to access a <a href="#Members">member</a> of a nullable type, known as <i>dereferencing</i>,
                        or an element of an array where either has a value of null, a <a href="#Errors_and_Exception_Handling">NullReferenceException</a> will be thrown.
                        A normal value type can't be assigned null and attempting to do so will result in a <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a> Normal value types
                        have a default value when declared which for the built-in types is <code>false</code> for a <code>bool</code> and <code>0</code> for all numeric
                        types. A value type can be made nullable when declared by using the <code>?</code> suffix in the
                        <span class="nowrap">form <code>T? a;</code>.</span> It can then be assigned null with the null value being in addition to the type's existing
                        range of possible values.</p>
                    <p>More recently C# introduced <i>nullable aware context</i> and <i>nullable reference types</i> to help in avoiding null reference exceptions.
                        Similarly, as with value types, in a nullable aware context a reference type declared in the form <code>T a;</code> is non-nullable and
                        <code>T? a;</code> is nullable. Unlike the value type however, both the nullable and non-nullable types can still be assigned null but in a
                        nullable aware context, assigning a non-nullable type null will result in a warning in the code editor. The nullable aware context
                        also produces other warnings such as 'dereferencing of a possibly null reference'. It should be noted that there are situations, even within the
                        nullable aware context, in which the compiler is unable to determine that a non-nullable type has been initialized null and will be unable to
                        produce a warning. There may also be occasions where the compiler is unable to determine that a variable or expression that is being assigned to a
                        non-nullable type variable can't be null. In this case you can apply the <a href="#Null-forgiving_operator">null-forgiving operator</a>
                        <code>!</code> in the form of <code>T!</code> to suppress the warning.</p>
                        <p>Some restrictions apply to a nullable type.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It must be checked and confirmed not to be null before dereferencing.</li>
                            <li>It can't be used as a <a href="#Inheriting_types">base type</a> or implemented as an <a href="#interface">interface.</a></li>
                            <li>It can't be used as an object's initialization.</li>
                            <li>It can't be used as part of type testing or be the type of a member access expression.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Nullable aware context can be applied to each code file as required through use of nullable annotation or globally to the project as a whole in
                            the project's properties. There are four levels nullable aware context, <code>disable</code>, <code>enable</code>, <code>warnings</code> and
                            <code>annotations</code>, details of which are in the <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference documentation</a> along with examples of
                            the various null reference warnings and  how code can be corrected to prevent the errors they pose. Starting with Visual Studio 2022 and
                            .NET 6.0, most of the <i>new project</i> templates set nullable aware context to <code>enabled</code> at the project level when a new project
                            is created.</p>
                        <p><em>Note:</em><i> Declaring a variable as nullable when the nullable aware context is disabled will result in a warning.</i></p>

                    <h3 id="Variable_lifetime">Variable lifetime</h3>
                    <p>Every computer has a finite amount of memory and when an object is no longer in use, it is essential to reclaim the memory it occupies or the
                        memory will become filled with unused objects. This must be done while a variable is still in <a href="#Scope">scope</a> otherwise it will become
                        unreachable and without a reference to it the memory, can no longer be reclaimed resulting in a <i>memory leak</i>. With an unmanaged programming
                        language, you are required to explicitly keep track of unreferenced objects and free up memory yourself but with a managed language, much of this
                        work is automatically done for you. C#, being a managed language, provides a memory management system called the <i>garbage collector</i> that
                        automatically tracks objects and when they are no longer referenced, marks them for garbage collection. When the memory is actually reclaimed is
                        completely under the control of the garbage collector.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i>C# also provides a WeakReference type that can still be garbage collected under certain conditions, even though there is a
                    reference to it.</i></p>
                    <p> While this takes care of most of the unmanaged side of memory management there are still
                        situations where memory leaks can occur even in a managed environment. It is up to the developer to put in place practices that prevent
                            this from happening.</p>



                    <p>The lifetime of a variable is the part of the program execution in which the variable is guaranteed to be stored in memory. For a
                        <a href="#Scope">local variable</a> this is at least for the time in which the execution enters and until it leaves its <a href="#Scope">scope</a>
                        within which the variable is contained. The lifetime can become extended if the variable is used as part of an
                        <a href="#Anonymous_functions">anonymous function.</a> In which case it remains in use until the <a href="#delegate">delegate</a> created by the
                        anonymous function and other objects that reference the variable are themselves, eligible for garbage collection. If a scope containing a local
                        variable is entered iteratively a new instance of the variable is created each time and lasts for a single iteration. The same applies for the
                        <i>iteration variable</i> in a <a href="#foreach_statement">foreach statement.</a> The lifetime of an instance field is the same as that of its
                        type's container and for a static variable is that of the application.

                    <p>In the following the first few examples demonstrate explicit declaration where you tell the editor what the variable's type is before it is used.
                        The first statement <code>int i;</code> declares the variable <code>i</code> to be a type of integer and then in <code>i = 1;</code> the
                        <code>=</code> <a href="#Assignment_operator">operator</a> assigns the literal value 1 to it. In <code>double j = 2.4</code> both the floating
                        point type <code>double j</code> is declared and the value 2.4 is assigned to it. In <code>int k = i + 3;</code> first the
                        <a href="#Expressions_and_Operators">expression</a> <code>i + 3</code> is evaluated then the resultant value 4 is assigned
                        <span>to <code>k</code>.</span> In <code>const double pi = 3.1415;</code> the constant <code>pi</code> is declared as a type <code>double</code>
                        and is assigned the value 3.1415.</p>
                    <p>C# also allows for <i>implicit</i> declaration through the use of the <code>var</code> keyword. This tells the compiler to determine the type of
                        variable to store based on the expression on the right side of the <code>=</code> operator. In the statement <code>var n = 3;</code> the compiler
                        interprets the 3 as an integer and based on its size assigns <code>n</code> a type of <code>int</code> and the value 3. In
                        <code>var d = 3.0</code> 3.0 is interpreted as a floating-point number and <code>d</code> is assigned a type of <code>double</code> with a value
                        <code>3.0</code> . With <code>var x = i + n;</code> summing an <code>int</code> with an <code>int</code> results in an <code>int</code> so
                        <code>x</code> will be an <span class="nowrap"><code>int</code>.</span> In <code>var y = i + d;</code>summing an <code>int</code> with a
                        <code>double</code> will result in a <code>double</code> so <code>y</code> is a <span class="nowrap"><code>double</code>.</span> As can be seen
                        care must be taken when using <code>var</code> as it is easy to end up with a type that was not expected. It should also be mentioned that there
                        is much debate as to the use of the <code>var</code> keyword which will be left for the reader to research.</p>
                    <p>The next eight <code>Console.WriteLine</code> statements write the values of i, j, k, pi, n, d, x and y to the console. Note that the default
                        behavior of <code>Console.WriteLine</code> is to truncate a number if the fractional part is zero so <code>d</code> and <code>y</code> are written
                        as 3 and 4 respectively. The four statements that follow introduce the <code>GetType()</code> <a href="#Methods">method.</a> As the name suggests
                        this method gets the type of the variable supplied. <code>Console.WriteLine</code> then writes these to the console. When run, the program will
                        write the result as shown in the example to the console. For <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> this will be <code>System.Int32</code> and for
                        <code>d</code> and <code>y</code> <code>System.Double</code> where <code>System</code> is a <a href="#Namespaces">namespace.</a> C# has a number
                        of <a href="#Keywords_and_Specifications">keywords</a> for commonly used types. In this example <code>int</code> is the keyword for
                        <code>System.Int32</code> and <code>double</code> the keyword <code>System.Double</code> (note the capital 'D'). Both can be used in code but in
                        general the keyword is favoured by most.</p>

                    <h3 id="Variable_declaration_and_assignment_syntax_errors">Variable declaration and assignment syntax errors</h3>
                    <p><a href="#Syntax_errors">Syntax errors</a> that occur when declaring and assigning variables will prevent the program from being compiled. The editor identifies these errors
                        and notifies you by placing a <u class="error">red wavy underline</u> under the part of the statement that is causing them. By moving the mouse
                        over the line, a message will popup detailing the error. Some errors can be quite cryptic so following are a few examples and an explanation of
                        what they mean.</p>
                    <p><i>The name 'p' does not exist in the current context</i> - Before a variable can be used, it must first be declared either explicitly with
                        the use of a type followed by an identifier <code>int p;</code> or implicitly by use of the <code>var</code> keyword <code>var p = 0;</code></p>
                    <p><i>A local variable or function 'i' is already defined in this scope</i> - Only one unique instance of a variable can exist within a
                        <a href="#Scope">scope.</a> As <code>int i = 1;</code> has already declared variable <code>i</code>, the next statement
                        <code>int <u class="error">i</u> = 2;</code> is evaluated by the editor as an attempt to declare a second
                        <span class="nowrap">variable <code>i</code>.</span></p>
                    <p><i>Cannot use variable 'b' before it is declared</i> - C# executes statements in the order they appear in the code from top down. In this case
                        <code><u class="error">b</u> = 1;</code> has been written above <span class="nowrap"><code>int b;</code>.</span> Reversing the order of these two
                        statements will resolve this error.</p>
                    <p><i>Use of unassigned local variable 'k'</i> - C# requires variables declared within a local <a href="#Scope">scope</a> to be assigned a value
                        before they can be used. Here <code>int k;</code> declares that a variable <code>k</code> of type <code>int</code> but does not assign it a value.
                        When declaring a variable a value can simultaneously be assigned to it through the use of the <code>=</code>
                        <a href="#Assignment_operator">operator</a> as in <span class="nowrap"><code>int k = 1;</code>.</span> Alternatively, a variable can be assigned a
                        value after being declared and before being used such as adding <code>k = 1;</code> after <code>int k;</code> and before
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>j = i + k;</code> .</span> Note that it is only variables on the right side of the <code>=</code> operator that need to
                        have a value assigned so the use of the <code>j</code> which is declared but not assigned a value on the left side is valid. C# also has the
                        <code>default</code> keyword which allows any variable to be assigned its default value such as
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>int k = default;</code> .</span> In this case <code>k</code>  would have a value of 0.</p>
                    <p><i>Cannot implicitly convert type 'double' to 'int'. An explicit conversion exists (Are you missing a cast?)</i> - In all the following cases
                        an attempt is being made to assign a variable of type <code>int</code> a value of type <span class="nowrap"><code>double</code>.</span> C# does
                        not allow the assignment of a value to a variable that could unwittingly result in a conversion that produces a loss of information. By assigning
                        a floating-point <code>double</code> to an <code>int</code>, the fractional part after the decimal point could be lost. As can be seen from the
                        examples it may not be obvious at first that a conversion is occurring.</p>
                    <p><code>i = <u class="error">d</u>;</code> an attempt is being made to assign the value in <code>d</code> which was declared a
                        <code>double</code> to <code>i</code> which was declared an <span class="nowrap"><code>int</code>.</span></p>
                    <p><code>i = <u class="error">3.0</u>;</code> the variable <code>i</code> which was declared as an <code>int</code> is being assigned the literal
                        <code>3.0</code> which is interpreted as a <code>double</code> by the editor.</p>
                    <p><code>b = <u class="error">i + d</u>;</code> as <code>i</code>is an <code>int</code> and <code>d</code> a <code>double</code> the result of
                     <code>i + d</code> is first evaluated by the editor to be a <code>double</code> so assigning this to <code>b</code> produces the error.</p>
                    <p><code>b = <u class="error">i + x</u>;</code> in the previous statement <code>var x = i + d;</code> <code>i + d</code> was evaluated by the editor
                        to be a <code>double</code> and is allowed to be assigned to <code>x</code> through the use of the <code>var</code> keyword. This results in
                        <code>i + x</code> also being interpreted as a <code>double</code> so assigning it to the int <code>b</code> produces the error.</p>
                    <p><code>d = i;</code> there is no possibility of information loss from an <code>int</code> to a <code>double</code> so this is allowed.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>C# has a number of explicit methods that allow for a <a href="#Type_conversion">conversion</a> that results in information loss
                        without resulting in an error.</i></p>
                    <p><i>The left-hand side of an assignment must be a variable, property or indexer</i> - Here <code>pi</code> is a constant and as its value can't be
                        changed so attempting to results in this error.</p>
                    <p><i>The expression assigned to 'area' must be constant</i> - As <code>area</code> has been declared a <code>const</code> the use of the variable
                        <code>i</code> in <code>i * 3 * 3</code> produces this error.</p>
                    <p><i>Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'int' and 'bool'</i> - C# does not allow the conversion of a boolean value to a number so
                        attempting a numeric addition between an <code>int</code> and a <code>bool</code> produces this error.</p>

                    <h3 id="#Boxing_and_unboxing">Boxing and unboxing</h3>
                    <p>Boxing is the converting of a value type to an <code>object</code> type and unboxing is the converting from an <code>object</code> type to a value
                        type. This is possible as <a href="#Polymorphism">polymorphism</a>, the ability to substitute any <a href="#Inheriting_types">inherited</a>
                        derived type with a base type, is a core principle of C# and the <code>object</code> type is the ultimate base type for all other types. Boxing is
                        an implicit operation whereas unboxing is explicit which means that the latter will require a cast. Boxing and unboxing have
                        mostly been replaced by generic types and should be avoided due to performance issues. Boxing requires a new
                        object to be created in memory and the combined boxing and unboxing operations can take up to 24 times longer than that of the equivalent
                        assignment of simple value and reference types. Additionally, due to the explicit cast when unboxing, knowledge is required of the type that was
                        originally boxed. The main use of boxing and unboxing now is when dealing with legacy code.</p>
                    <p> The following example demonstrate
                        boxing and unboxing a value type to and from an object.</p>

            // This is an implicit operation so a cast is not required.
            object o = 1;

            // The previously boxed object 'o' is unboxed back into a
            // value type. Here the conversion is explicit requiring a cast.
            int j = (int)o;

                    <p>A string is a sequence of Unicode (UTF-16) characters that represent text. The maximum length of a string is based on a memory size of 2GB which
                        is approximately 1 billion characters. String literals can be regular or verbatim and/or interpolated. Each can contain zero or more characters
                        enclosed in a pair of double quotes.</p>
                    <p>Regular string literals can contain escaped characters. They can't span multiple lines so to split a statement with a long string literal across
                        two or more lines, each part of the string on each line must first be enclosed in a pair of double quotes. The <code>+</code> concatenation
                        operator is then placed between each string to join them together.</p>
                    <p>Verbatim string literals are prefixed with the verbatim <span class="nowrap">identifier <code>@</code>.</span> Any escaped character will be
                        interpreted verbatim except <code>'\"'</code> which will be interpreted as one double quote. Verbatim string literals can span multiple lines.
                        There must be no white space between the <code>@</code> character and the string.</p>
                    <p>Interpolated strings are prefixed with the interpolation identifier <code>$</code> which indicates that they may contain <i>interpolation
                        expressions</i>. These can contain variables and other special characters that instruct the compiler how to format the string at
                        <span class="nowrap">runtime</span>. Interpolation expressions are wrapped in a pair of braces. There must be no white space between the
                        <code>$</code> identifier and the string. To use a brace as a character in an interpolated string two braces <code>{{</code> or
                        <code>}}</code> must be used. Interpolation expressions include a vast range of options, information of which can be found in the
                        <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference documentation</a></p>
                    <p>The interpolation identifier can be used in conjunction with the verbatim identifier and the order of the identifiers doesn't matter.</p>

                    <p>Strings are immutable, that is once created they cannot be changed. C# operators that appear to change a string actually creates a new modified
                        copy of the original string. This means that the performance of a program can suffer when a string is repeatedly manipulated. In these cases,
                        C# provides StringBuilder which like a string, also represents a sequence of characters but unlike a string is mutable allowing changes to the
                        sequence. When the operations to the StringBuilder sequence have been completed it can be converted to a string.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates how to use StringBuilder</p>
<pre><code>using System.Text;

namespace StringBuilderExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create a new instance of StringBuilder
            StringBuilder builder = new();
            builder.AppendLine("Hello World");
            builder.AppendLine("Hello World");
            builder.AppendLine("Hello World");
            builder.AppendLine("Hello World");

            // Convert the StringBuilder sequence to a string
            String message = builder.ToString();

            // Write the string to the console;
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}

// The example writes the following to the console
// Hello World
// Hello World
// Hello World
// Hello World

                    <p>The <code>=&gt;</code> operator has two uses, as part of a <i>lambda expression</i> or an <i>expression-bodied member</i> definition.</p>
                    <p>A lambda expression is comprised of a set of input parameters on the left which are then passed into the body on the right which are separated
                        using the <code>=&gt;</code> operator. They are used to create <a href="#Anonymous_functions">anonymous functions.</a></p>
                    <p>An expression-bodied member definition provides a shorthand way of writing the body of a member. In this case the <code>=&gt;</code> operator is
                        used to separate the header of the member and its body which can only contain a single expression. Supported members are:</p>

                    <h3 id="Array">Array</h3>
                    <p>An array is like a box with separate compartments in which only one item called an <i>element</i> can be stored in each. They can be
                        single-dimensional,  multi-dimensional or jagged and all items must be of the same type. A single-dimensional array is like  one row  of
                        compartments. A multidimensional array can contain rows, columns or more up to a maximum of 32 dimensions. A jagged array is like storing a
                        separate box within each compartment of the first where each one could have its own set of dimensions with different sizes. A jagged array is
                        sometimes called an array of arrays. In addition to the examples shown here C# also provides the <i>Array</i> class which provides a set of
                        methods for manipulating arrays, information of which can be found in the <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference documentation.</a></p>

                    <p>An array is immutable which means that the number of dimensions and elements or <i>Length</i> of an array must be declared when the array is
                        created and can't be changed. An array can be recreated by using the <code>new</code> keyword which deletes and replaces the existing array
                        <em>and its data</em> with a new one. There are a number of different ways in which to create an array which can also include initializing the
                        element values. If not initialized the default value for the elements in a single-dimensional or multi-dimensional array will be 0 for numeric
                        types and <a href="#null">null</a> for reference types. As a jagged array stores other arrays, the default type is always null.</p>

                    <p>Arrays are normally zero index based so the elements in a dimension of length n will be accessed by index values of 0 through n-1. Whilst it is

                    <h3 id="Collections">Collections</h3>
                    <p>.NET provides a number of data structures grouped under the category of collections. They provide common functionality such as to add, remove and
                        modify either individual elements or a range of elements.</p>
                    <p>There are two main types of collections, generic and non-generic. Generic collections take in a type parameter making them type safe at compile time
                        which allows IntelliSense to indicate <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax errors.</a> Non-generic collections store items as type <i>object</i> which
                        requires casting when accessing the data within them. Because of this, non-generic collections are less commonly used today and are mostly found
                        in legacy code.</p>
                    <p>Following is a list of some common collection types but only examples of <i>List&lt;T&gt;</i> and <i>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</i>
                        will be discussed in this article.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>List&lt;T&gt;</i> - A collection of items stored by index</li>
                        <li><i>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</i> - Used to store items as key/value pairs</li>
                        <li><i>Queue&lt;T&gt;</i> - Items are accessed first in first out (FIFO)</li>
                        <li><i>Stack&lt;T&gt;</i> - Items are accessed last in first out (LIFO)</li>
                        <li><i>LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</i> - Items are accessed sequentially</li>
                        <li><i>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</i> - Provides notification through events when items are added or removed</li>
                        <li><i>SortedList&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</i> - A sorted collection</li>
                        <li><i>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</i> - A set for mathematical functions</li>
                        <li><i>SortedSet&lt;T&gt;</i> - A sorted set for mathematical functions</li>

                    <p>A <i>List&lt;T&gt;</i> is a strongly typed generic collection of objects accessed by an int type <i>index</i>. Unlike an array, a list does
                        not have a fixed size and as such does not have to be declared. It provides a number of useful methods for manipulating its data such as add,
                        remove, sort, find and clear.</p>

                    <h3 id="Enumerators">Enumerators</h3>
                    <p>The <code>enum</code> keyword is used to declare an enumerator which provides a list of named constants. The code editor allows you to use these
                        names to assign the underlying constant values to variables. You can declare the type and value of each constant or allow the editor to declare
                        them for you. The default type for the value is an integer and the list is zero based. A value in an enum is accessed through the enum's
                        identifier, followed by a period, followed by the identifier of one of the constants. An enum is a value type.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates enumerator declaration and use.</p>
<pre><code>namespace Enumerators
{
    class Program
    {
        // The default underlying type is an 'int'
        enum Day { Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat }

        // This declares that the underlying month type is declared as 'long'
        enum Month : long { Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var day = Day.Tue;
            var dayType = day.GetType();
            var underlyingDayType = Enum.GetUnderlyingType(dayType);
            Console.WriteLine($"Day is {day}, value is {(int)day}," +
                $" Type is {dayType.Name}, underlying type is {underlyingDayType}");
            var month = Month.Nov;
            var monthType = month.GetType();
            var underlyingMonthType = Enum.GetUnderlyingType(monthType);
            Console.WriteLine($"Month is {month}, value is {(long)month}," +
                $" Type is {monthType.Name}, underlying type is {underlyingMonthType}");
        }
    }
}

// The example prints the following to the console
// Day is Tue, value is 2, Type is Day, underlying type is System.Int32
// Month is Nov, value is 10, Type is Month, underlying type is System.Int64

                    <!-- SECTION Tuple -->
                    <h3 id="Tuple">Tuple</h3>
                    <p>A <code>ValueTuple</code> type, commonly called a <i>tuple</i>, is a mutable value type that provides a concise syntax for creating a structure
                        that groups multiple different types together. It does this by creating a <a href="#Access_modifiers">public</a> <a href="#Fields">field</a>
                        element for each type.</p>
                    <p>The tuple syntax is in the form of a set of round brackets containing a comma separated list of at least two <i>elements</i>, with optional
                        identifiers. The compiler provides each element with a default identifier in the form <code>Itemn</code> where n is the position of the element in
                        the list. Optional identifiers are in addition to default identifiers such that an element of a tuple called <code>t</code> can be accessed in the
                        form of either <code>t.Itemn</code> or <span class="nowrap"><code>t.OptionalName</code>.</span> An element can't be optionally named  with a
                        default identifier that is normally used for another element, i.e., naming the first element <code>Item2</code> results in a
                        <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a> Additionally, tuples contain a number of <a href="#Members">members</a> and the use of their
                        identifiers will also result in an error. By convention, as the elements are public, they are normally named using <i>PascalCase</i>. Elements can
                        also be assigned values when being declared. A common use for a tuple is the return type for a
                        <a href="#Methods">method</a> where only a single type is allowed, as multiple types can be returned wrapped in the one
                        <code>ValueTuple</code> type.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> If an optional identifier is provided IntelliSense won't provide an option for the default identifier but it can still be entered
                        manually.</i></p>
                    <p>There are a number of different ways to declare and assign values to a tuple as demonstrated in the following example.</p>

            t1 = ("Some text", 1);
            Console.WriteLine($"Item1: {t1.Item1}, Item2: {t1.Item2}");

            // Implicitly declare a tuple with 2 elements of
            // type string and int and assign values to it.
            var t2 = ("My dog has fleas", true);

            // Explicitly declare a tuple with named elements and assign values to them
            (string Name, int Age) person1 = ("Andrew", 21);

                        kind of template and when a program runs, objects, also called instances, can be created based on a type. This allows multiple instances to be
                        created each with their own state. Within a C# project, types can be combined with other resources such as media and text files, which are then
                        compiled to create an <a href="#Dependencies_and_Namespaces"><i>assembly</i></a> in the form of either an executable(.exe) or library(.dll) file.

                            dialog will open.</li>
                        <li><b>Class</b> should be selected at the top of the list but if it isn't, type <i>class</i> in the search bar in the top right of the dialog and

                        <li>At the bottom of the dialog in the name text box type the name of the class then click <b>Add</b> and the new class file will be added to the

                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> The Class template provided by Visual Studio in the Add New Item dialog creates a file with a class without an access modifier.
                        The file will also include using directives for various namespaces dependent on the project's type. Adding a class to a folder will result in a
                        <a href="#Dependencies_and_Namespaces">namespace</a> of the form

                    <p>The following example defines a <code>Square</code> class with <a href="#Constructors">constructors</a>, <a href="#Methods">methods</a>,
                        <a href="#Fields">fields</a>,
                        <a href="#Properties">properties</a> and <a href="#Events">events.</a> There are two constructors, the first has a
                        <a href="#Parameters_signatures_and_overloading">signature</a> with one parameter and the second with three in which the third parameter is
                        optional. The <code>Program</code> class creates three instances of the <code>Square</code> class. The first uses the first constructor, the
                        second the second constructor without passing an argument to the third parameter. The third also uses the second constructor but does pass an
                        argument. It also adds the <code>Square_AreaChanged</code> event handler to handle the <code>AreaChanged</code> event of both the
                        <code>square2</code> and <code>square3</code> instances. When the program is run, after writing the initial area values to the console it then
                        changes the <code>Width</code> property directly on the <code>square2</code> instance and <code>Height</code> on <code>square3</code> through the
                        <code>SetHeight</code> method. This triggers the <code>AreaChanged</code> event in each which then calls the <code>Square_AreaChanged</code> event
                        handler which in turn writes the updated values to the console.</p>

                    <p>Members are declared within the type that defines the object. All members within an object can access each other irrespective of the location at
                        which they are declared. Access to members external to the object is controlled through the use of
                        <a href="#Access_Modifiers">access modifier</a> keywords and the access level of the object that contains them. If omitted a member's
                        access level will be private by default. Members can also be marked with the <a href="#static">static</a>,
                        <a href="#abstract">abstract</a> or <a href="#sealed">sealed</a> keywords which are mutually exclusive. A calling object accesses the member of
                        another in the same <a href="#namespace">namespace</a> through the object's identifier if it is an instance, or the type's identifier if it is
                        static, followed by a period, followed by the member's identifier such as <code>object.Member</code> or <code>Type.Member</code> respectively. If
                        an object needs to access a static member of an object in another namespace then the fully qualified name is required in the form of

                        namespaces, types and members to choose from as you enter them.</p>
                    <p>All members except fields, constant fields and events that have a single expression support implementation through the use of

                        producing unpredictable results. In a <a href="#Inheriting_types">derived</a> type a virtual base member can optionally be
                        <a href="#override">overridden</a> where as an abstract base member <em>must</em> be overridden by a member with the same signature that is marked

                    <p>Methods provide the behavior of an object and are the basis for all <a href="#Program_execution">program execution</a> in C#. This could be reading
                        a file, calculating a value, writing to the screen, etc. It does this by acting as a container for one or more
                        <a href="#Code_Syntax">statements.</a></p>
                    <p>A statement in a method can pass program execution on to another method known as <i>calling</i> or <i>invoking</i>, with the method that
                        contains the statement known as the <code>caller</code>. In normal circumstances, execution is returned to the caller through a return statement
                        or, if the invoked method returns <code>void</code>, the end of the method is reached. Invoking a method is in the form of
                        <code>instance.Method(parameters)</code> for an instance of a type and <code>TypeName.Method(parameters)</code> for a
                        <a href="#static">static</a> type. To call an instance method an object must first be instantiated from the type that contains it.</p>
                    <p>A method declaration consists of two parts, the <i>header</i> and the <i>body</i>. The header must have a return type, an identifier and a pair of
                        round brackets that can optionally enclose values, known as <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">parameters</a>, that can be
                        <i>passed in</i> to the method for use by the statements it contains. The identifier, parameters and, depending on the context, the return type
                        define the <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">signature</a> of the method which is used in determining the
                        <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">overloading</a> of a method and its use with a <a href="#delegate">delegate.</a> A class can
                        contain multiple <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">overloads</a> of a method. If no value is to be returned then the return type
                        must be declared as <code>void</code> otherwise the method must return a value of the type declared in the header. Optional attributes and
                        <a href="#Modifiers">modifiers</a> can be applied to a method and its parameters that can change accessibility and behavior. The body contains the
                        implementation of the method and can consist of either a code block or when marked with either the <a href="#abstract">abstract</a> or
                        <a href="#extern">extern</a> modifier, a semicolon indicating that the method implementation is to be declared in a
                        <a href="#Inheriting_types">derived</a> class or an external library respectively. Methods with a single expression can be implemented in the form
                        of an <a href="#The_lambda_and_expression-body_definition_operator">expression-bodied member.</a></p>

                    <h3 id="Constructors">Constructors</h3>
                    <p>When an object is created a constructor is called that can be used to set its data and provide other actions that initialize the object's
                        state. The syntax for a constructor is similar to that of a <a href="#Methods">method</a> in that it has a
                        <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">signature</a> that can take in parameters and is a container for one or more
                        <a href="#Code_Syntax">statements.</a> Unlike a method it cannot return a value, its identifier is always that of the type that contains it and
                        it can only be called once when the object is created.</p>
                    <p>A constructor can be marked with various <a href="#Modifiers">modifiers</a> that change its behavior and an instance constructor can be
                        <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">overloaded.</a> By using the <code>this</code> keyword, a constructor can call another
                        overloaded constructor when an object is created. In an instance type, if no constructors are declared the compiler will provide a default
                        parameterless constructor with an empty code block. If constructors are declared then the compiler will not declare the default constructor, so in
                        this case if a parameterless constructor is required it will need to be explicitly declared. To create an instance of a type the <code>new</code>
                        keyword is used to call an instance constructor. Constructors with a single expression can be implemented in the form of an
                        <a href="#The_lambda_and_expression-body_definition_operator">expression-bodied member</a></p>
                    <p>Both instance and static constructors can be declared in <a href="#class">classes</a>, <a href="#struct">structs</a> and
                        <a href="#record">records</a> whereas only static constructors can be declared in an <a href="#interface">interface.</a> A class or record can
                        declare both parameterless and parameterized constructors whereas a struct can only declare parameterized constructors (<em>Note:</em> <i>
                        parameterized constructors will be allowed in structs beginning with C# 10.0</i>). An instance constructor cannot access a field marked static
                        readonly and a static class cannot contain an instance constructor. An instance type can contain a static constructor but a static constructor
                        cannot be used to create an instance of a type.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates the declaration and usage of constructors. The first class called <code>DefaultClass</code> does not explicitly
                        declare a constructor so the compiler declares a default parameterless constructor that can be called to instantiate it.
                        <code>ParameterizedClass</code> explicitly declares a single parameterized constructor. As this prevents the compiler from implicitly declaring a
                        parameterless constructor, when an attempt is made to instantiate the class using one, it results in a <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a>
                        The <code>Person</code> class has four explicitly declared overloaded constructors. The first is parameterless so creating an instance of
                        <code>Person</code> using a parameterless constructor is permitted and it sets the values of the two <a href="#Fields">fields</a>
                        <code>_firstName</code> and <code>_lastName</code> to <i>First name</i> and <i>Last name</i> respectively. The second constructor has two
                        parameters and sets <code>_firstName</code> and <code>_lastName</code> to the values passed in. The third constructor has one parameter and makes
                        use of the expression-bodied member syntax setting only the value of the <code>_firstName</code> field. The fourth constructor has three
                        parameters, <code>id</code>, <code>firstName</code> and <span class="nowrap"><code>lastName</code>.</span> Using the <code>this</code> keyword it
                        calls the second constructor, passing in <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> then uses <code>id</code> to set the <code>_id</code>
                        field using expression-bodied syntax.</p>

                    <h3 id="Fields">Fields</h3>
                    <p>A variable declared inside a type but outside any other member is called a field and is used to store data about an object. They are declared using
                        an optional <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, followed by the field's type, followed by an identifier that is unique within the
                        field's containing type. Fields are normally declared either private or protected. This provides <a href="#Encapsulation">encapsulation</a> and
                        access to a field is achieved through other members within the type including <a href="#Properties">properties</a>,
                        <a href="#Methods">methods</a>, <a href="#Indexers">indexers</a> and <a href="#Constructors">constructors.</a> This has the advantage of allowing
                        for data validation and performing other tasks before or after changing its value. Most commonly, external access to a field is through a property
                        and when this is done the field is called a <i>backing field</i>.</p>
                    <p>A variable field does not have to be initialized with a value and if not, will be initialized by the compiler to the default value for its type.
                        When the program is run, field initialization occurs in the order of</p>
                    <p><i>declaration &gt; constructor &gt; object initializer</i>.</p>
                    <p>This means that setting a field's value in a constructor will overwrite a value set in the declaration and setting its value in an
                        object-initializer will overwrite the value set both in the field declaration, a constructor or an init accessor of a property.</p>
                    <p>A variable field can be made readonly through the use of the <code>readonly</code> keyword in which case it can only be initialized either by
                        declaration or in a constructor. How this effects a variable though depends on whether it is a value or a reference type. As a value type contains
                        its data it can't be changed after being initialized. As a reference type only stores the address in memory of the data, it is only this reference
                        that can't be changed and not the data itself. For example, if a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is declared as a public read-only field, code outside
                        the class can still add and remove items from the list.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> Whilst a <a href="#string">string</a> is a reference type as it is immutable declaring it <code>readonly</code> prevents it from
                        being assigned to after initialization.</i></p>
                    <p>By convention fields are normally declared at the top of a class before any other code. Access to a field by code external to the type is in the
                        form of <span class="nowrap"><code>instance.Field</code>.</span></p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates field declaration and use.</p>

                    <p>Like a variable field, a constant field is declared inside a type but outside any other member. They are declared using an optional

                        it is declared. As with variable fields, constant fields are normally declared at the top of the type. By convention a constant field's identifier
                        is written in all capitals such as <span class="nowrap"><code>CONSTANT</code>.</span></p>
                        <p>A constant field is already effectively <a href="#static">static</a> so the <code>static</code> keyword cannot be applied to it. Like static

                    <h3 id="Properties">Properties</h3>
                    <p>A property is a way of allowing external code to have controlled access to data within an object. It does this by providing special methods that
                        can read from and write to the data, most often a single field which in this context is known as a <i>backing field</i>. The data the property
                        accesses must be of the same type as the property's declared type. Whilst the default access level for a property is private, an optional
                        <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a> is normally applied to allow for access outside its containing type. Declaration of a property can
                        take one of two forms, <i>manually-implemented</i> or <i>auto-implemented</i>.</p>
                    <p>Manually-implemented properties can be declared using an optional access modifier, followed by the property's type, followed by an identifier that
                        is unique within the property's containing type, followed by a pair of braces that define a code block which is the body of the property. This can
                        contain one or both of two special methods which include a <i>getter</i> declared using the <code>get</code> keyword to read data from the object
                        and a <i>setter</i> declared using either the <code>set</code> or <code>init</code> keywords to write data to the object. Collectively
                        <code>get</code>, <code>set</code> and <code>init</code> are called <i>accessors</i> with <code>set</code> and <code>init</code> being mutually
                        exclusive. A property can be made read/write by using both a getter and a setter, read-only by only using a getter or write-only by only using a
                        setter, though the latter is an extremely rare situation.</p>
                    <p>Both the getter and the setter each have their own code block. Within the setter code block the <code>value</code> keyword is used to hold the
                        value passed in to the property which is to be assigned to the data, in the form of <span class="nowrap"><code>data = value;</code>.</span> Other
                        statements can be placed in the setter to validate the value before it is written to the data or to perform an action before or after this is
                        done. This could include <a href="#Events">raising an event</a> to communicate to other objects that the property's value has changed. Within
                        getter code block this usually takes the form of <span class="nowrap"><code>return backingField</code>.</span> As with <code>set</code>, other
                        code can also be placed within the <code>get</code> code block. In both cases such code should be limited and where more complex procedures are
                        required a <a href="#Methods">method</a> should be utilized. An alternative to <code>set</code> is <code>init</code> which can only be called by
                        the constructor or an object-initializer, which makes the property read-only after it has been initialized during the object's instantiation. As
                        with <code>set</code> a property can be made write-only by only using <span class="nowrap"><code>init</code>.</span> The <code>set</code> and
                        <code>init</code> keywords are mutually exclusive. Collectively <code>set</code>, <code>init</code> and <code>get</code> are called
                        <i>accessors</i>. An accessor that has a single expression can be implemented in the form of an
                        <a href="#The_lambda_and_expression-body_definition_operator">expression-bodied member.</a></p>
                    <p>The default access for accessors is that of the property containing them, but can be changed through the use of access modifiers provided that</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the property is read/write</li>
                        <li>only one of the accessors has the access modifier applied</li>
                        <li>the access modifier is more restrictive than the property container</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This means for example, if a property is public and the <code>set</code> accessor is made private then the property can be read from outside the
                        class but only set by other members within it. </p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> Applying an access modifier to a <code>get</code> accessor is not recommended and making an <code>init</code> accessor private
                         has the effect that the property can only be initialized in a constructor and <b>not</b> an object-initializer. </i></p>
                    <p>Auto-implemented properties have accessors that are declared without an implementation code block and without declaring a separate  backing field
                        allowing the property to be written with one line of code. During runtime the compiler creates a hidden private backing field that can only be
                        accessed through the property. An advantage of an auto-implemented property is that it can be initialized through the declaration. For a
                        read/write property either both accessors must be manually-implemented or auto-implemented. An auto-implemented property must always have a
                        <code>get</code> accessor so it cannot be write-only.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the order of getters and setters in both manually-implemented or auto-implemented properties doesn't matter, by convention getters are
                        normally declared first. Access to a property by code external to the type is in the form of <code>instance.Property</code> for an instance of a
                        type and <code>TypeName.Property</code> for a <a href="#static">static</a> type.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates property declaration and use.</p>

                    <h3 id="Events">Events</h3>
                    <p>An event is a way for a class to communicate with other objects that something within it has occurred. This could be a button click, completion of
                        a task, change of state, etc. The class that <i>raises</i> the event is known as a <i>publisher</i> and the objects receiving the event
                        are known as <i>subscribers</i>. When a publisher declares an event, it in turn allows the declaration of a special type of multicast
                        <a href="#delegate">delegate</a> and provides methods that a subscriber can use to add or remove instances of the delegate. When an event is
                        raised, the delegate is then used to invoke a method within the subscriber which in this case is known as an <i>event handler</i>. By being
                        multicast, the delegate allows multiple objects to subscribe to the same event or for a subscriber to use the same event handler to handle the same
                        type of event from multiple publishers.</p>
                    <p>Whilst a delegate can declare a signature that defines a return type, a multicast delegate only returns a value from the last event handler that
                        was invoked. For this reason, the standard event delegate signature is one that returns void and contains two parameters. The first parameter is
                        an object that refers to the instance that raised the event. The second is a type that can optionally contain event data including values that can
                        be changed in the event handler to effectively supply a return value. A common type for containing event data is one that is
                        <a href="#Inheriting_types">derived</a> from the <code>EventArgs</code> class.</p>
                    <p>C# .NET provides many built-in delegates for use with events which are suffixed with <i>EventHandler</i>. There two most common are
                        <code>EventHandler</code> and <span class="nowrap"><code>EventHandler&lt;TEventArgs&gt;</code>.</span></p>
                    <p><code>EventHandler</code> is used when the event does not include event data. It declares <code>EventArgs</code> as the second parameter which is
                        set to the <code>EventArg.Empty</code> field when invoking the event.</p>
                    <p><code>EventHandler&lt;TEventArgs&gt;</code> can be used to send event data. Originally it was required that the return data type be derived from
                        <code>EventArgs</code> which is why <i>TEventArgs</i> is still mentioned in much of the online documentation, but that constraint has been removed
                        and any type can now be specified. An <code>EventArgs</code> derived type is still advantageous, particularly where more complex types are
                        employed and for reasons of <a href="#Polymorphism_implementation">polymorphism.</a> If there is a requirement to return a value then a reference
                        type should be used.</p>
                    <p>An event can't be invoked from outside the class that contains it so an additional method is required to call the event. It is common that such a
                        method be marked <code>virtual</code> so they can be <a href="#override">overridden</a> if the class can be inherited. The
                        naming convention for such a method is the name of the event prefixed with <i>On</i> such as <span class="nowrap"><code>OnEvent</code>.</span> The
                        naming convention for subscriber event handlers is the instance or type identifier followed by an underscore followed by the event identifier such
                        as <span class="nowrap"><code>instance_SomeEvent</code>.</span> An event handler can also be in the form of a
                        <a href="#Lambda_expressions">lambda expression.</a></p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>When an event has multiple subscribers the order in which they receive the event is not always guarantied. A subscriber should
                        not rely on another having already handled the event.</i></p>
                    <p>In the following example the <code>Clock</code> class declares <code>Started</code>, <code>Stopped</code> and <code>Ticked</code> events and the
                        <code>Program</code> class subscribes and declares event handlers to all of them. The <code>Clock</code> class also declares a <code>Timer</code>
                        instance that provides a continuous <code>Timer.Elapsed</code> event at one second intervals which is handled by a <code>Timer_Elapsed</code>
                        event handler. This in turn calls the <code>OnTicked</code> method that then invokes the <code>Ticked</code> event. When the
                        <code>_clock_Tick</code> event handler in <code>Program</code> is invoked it writes the current time to the console. The
                        <code>Clock.Started</code> event takes a <code>DateTime</code> type which is used to pass the start time to the <code>_clock_Started</code> event
                        handler. The <code>Clock.Stopped</code> event takes a custom type <code>StoppedEventArgs</code> derived from <code>EventArgs</code> which is used
                        to pass the stop time to the <code>_clock_Stopped</code> event handler. <code>StoppedEventArgs</code> has a <code>DateTime</code> type
                        <code>Time</code> property that is set by the constructor. The example also employs <code>Console.ReadKey</code> to test whether the user has
                        pressed the <b>Enter</b> key to end the program.</p>

                    <p>There are situations where you may wish to cancel an event. One such scenario is when closing a program and you want to give the user the
                        opportunity to save unsaved data before this occurs. C# .NET provides the <code>CancelEventHandler</code> delegate to achieve this which passes
                        a <code>CancelEventArgs</code> parameter to the event handler. <code>CancelEventArgs</code> has a bool type property <code>Cancel</code> which can
                        be set in the event handler to indicate if the event should be cancelled.</p>
                    <p>In the following example the <code>ApplicationManager</code> class declares an <code>Exiting</code> event that in turn declares a
                        <code>CancelEventHandler</code> type delegate. The <code>Program</code> class subscribes to the <code>Exiting</code> event and declares an event
                        handler for this using a <a href="#Lambda_expressions">lambda expression.</a> Within the Main method are two while loops, one testing if the user
                        presses the <b>x</b> key, nested in another that tests if the <code>AllowExit</code> property is true. When the <b>x</b> key is pressed,
                        <code>Exit</code> is called which calls <code>OnExiting</code> which invokes the <code>Exiting</code> event. Within the <code>Exiting</code> event
                        handler in <code>Program</code>, the <code>CancelEventArgs.Cancel</code> property is set <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending if the
                        <b>y</b> key is pressed, then passed back to <code>OnExiting</code> then to <code>Exit</code> where it sets the <code>AllowExit</code> property.
                        Execution passes back to the while loops which it exits if <code>AllowExit</code> is true and the program then terminates.</p>

                    <h3 id="Indexers">Indexers</h3>
                    <p>An indexer allows an object to be indexed like an array. It is similar to a <a href="#Properties">property</a> but also takes an index value to set
                        or get a specific instance. To declare an indexer first an array or collection backing field is declared to store the instances to be indexed. The
                        indexer is then declared using an optional <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, followed by the <code>this</code> keyword, followed by
                        the type of indexer, followed by square brackets that contain one or more indexes separated by commas, with each consisting of the type of index
                        and an index identifier. Accessors are then used to set and/or get the instances from the backing field using the indexes that are passed in. The
                        same rules as those for read/write and accessibility of properties and accessors also apply to indexers except that an indexer cannot be static
                        and an indexer cannot be auto-indexed. Indexers can be <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">overloaded.</a></p>
                    <p>Access to an indexer by code external to the type is in the form of <code>instance.Indexer[index]</code></p>
                    <p>The following example declares a string collection which uses an indexer to index instances of itself. The <code>Program</code> class creates a new
                        <code>StringCollection</code> instance, assigns the string "Hello World" to the instance at index 0 in the collection, then retrieves the same and
                        finally writes its value to the console.</p>

                    <h4 id="Parameters">Parameters</h4>
                    <p>A parameter is a <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variable</a> declared as part of a member that allows a value from a calling
                        statement to be made available, or <i>passed in</i>, for use by the statements within the member. The corresponding value in the calling statement
                        is called an <i>argument</i>. Parameters are passed in, in the form of a comma separated list within a pair of round brackets that can contain
                        zero or more parameters. Arguments in the calling statement are also in the form of a comma separated list and must either be in the same order as
                        the list of parameters or in the form of named arguments. Parameters can be made optional in which case arguments can be omitted subject to
                        certain conditions. A parameter is defined by a type and an identifier and can be marked with a modifying keyword some of which are,
                        <code>ref</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>out</code> and <span class="nowrap"><code>params</code>.</span> Other than for a parameter marked
                        <code>out</code>, all arguments
                        passed in must be initialized first. A parameter marked <code>out</code> must be initialized before the called code returns.</p>
                    <p>With no modifier the default passing mode is to pass an argument into a parameter by value. If a value type is passed in by value, changing its
                        value within the called member will not affect the argument that was passed in. If a reference type is passed in by value, while it can't be
                        changed to refer to another object, the data it contains can still be changed.</p>
                    <p>A value type that is passed in by reference can be changed within the called member and a reference type passed in by reference can be changed to
                        refer to a different object. Both the argument in the calling code and the parameter in the called member must be marked with the <code>ref</code>
                        keyword.</p>
                    <p>If a parameter in the called member is marked with the <code>in</code> keyword, it becomes readonly and attempting to change a value type marked
                        this way or changing a reference type to refer to another object will result in a <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a> The data of a
                        reference type can still be changed. Only the parameter in the called member is required to be marked in.</p>
                    <p>An argument marked with the <code>out</code> keyword causes a value to be passed by reference. It does not have to be initialized first but must be
                        assigned a value in the called member. Both the argument and the parameter must be marked with the <code>out</code> keyword. The variable for the
                        argument can either be declared before or within the calling statement and can be assigned a type either explicitly or implicitly using the
                        <code>var</code> keyword. If implicitly declared before the calling statement, it must be assigned a value.</p>
                    <p>A parameter can be made optional by assigning it a default value in the called member parameter list using the assignment
                        <span class="nowrap">operator <code>=</code>.</span> The calling statement can then optionally assign an argument for the value. If an argument is
                        omitted then the default value is used. The default value assigned must be a constant expression, an expression in the form new ValueType() or an
                        expression in the form default(ValueType). All optional parameters must come after all other parameters other than one marked with the
                        <code>params</code> keyword. If an optional argument in the calling statement is provided then all preceding optional arguments must also be
                        provided.</p>
                    <p>A parameter marked with the <code>params</code> keyword allows a single-dimensional array of arguments to be passed in. The parameter marked this
                        way must come after all other parameters in the list. Arguments passed in from the calling statement are optional and can be either in the form of
                        a comma separated list or an externally declared array of the parameter type.</p>
                    <p>Named arguments allows the calling statement to assign values in an order different to the called member's parameter list. This is done by using
                        the parameter's identifier followed by a colon, optional whitespace and then a literal or a variable of the correct type. Named arguments can be
                        combined with positional arguments provided they precede all positional arguments or are used in their correct positions.</p>

                    <p>Multiple overloads of a member with the same identifier can exist within a type, provided that each has a unique signature defined by the
                        combination of certain elements in its declaration. These are as follows.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#Methods">Method</a> - identifier, the number, type and order of parameters, parameter passing mode(ref, value, in, out)</li>

                        <li><a href="#Methods">Operator</a> - identifier, the number, type and order of parameters</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Only one of <code>ref</code>, <code>in</code> or <code>out</code> modifiers can be used together with a parameter of the same identifier that has
                        no modifier.</p>
                    <p>Notably the signature does not include the parameter's identifier, the use of the <code>params</code> or <code>this</code> keywords, or whether the
                        parameter is optional. It also does not include the <a href="#access_modifiers">accessibility</a> of the member. A method's return type is not
                        part of its signature in the context of overloading but is in the context of use in <a href="#delegate">delegate</a>, in which case the method's
                        signature must match that of the delegate.</p>

                    <p>A <i>structure</i> usually referred to by its keyword <code>struct</code> is similar to a class with the following main differences.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A struct is a value type</li>
                        <li>The static, abstract and sealed modifiers cannot be applied to a struct</li>
                        <li>The readonly modifier can be applied to a struct</li>
                        <li>An instance field or property in a struct can't be initialized when a struct is declared.</li>
                        <li>A constructor in a struct must initialize all instance fields</li>
                        <li>A struct cannot have a parameterless constructor (<em>Note:</em> <i>will be allowed beginning with C# 10.0</i>) </li>
                        <li>A struct cannot have a finalizer</li>
                        <li>A struct cannot inherit or be inherited by another class or struct</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A struct is normally used to create a basic data type with little or no functionality. Within C# <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>,
                        <code>char</code> and <code>bool</code> are all examples of structs. As a struct is a value type so all instance fields it contains must be
                        assigned a value before it can be used. Although a parameterless constructor can't be declared in a struct, the compiler creates one which sets
                        all instance fields to their default values. This can then use this when instantiating a struct with the <code>new</code> keyword. If all instance
                        fields in a struct are accessible then a struct can be instantiated without using the <code>new</code> keyword. For example an integer can be
                        assigned the value 0 either by <code>int x = new();</code> or <span class="nowrap"><code>int x = 0;</code>.</span></p>
                    <p>The following example declares a struct called <code>Box</code> with <code>Width</code>, <code>Height</code> and <code>Depth</code> fields and a
                        method called <span class="nowrap"><code>GetVolume</code>.</span> It demonstrates several ways to declare and assign values to a struct and then
                        writes the values to the console.</p>
<pre><code>namespace Structs
{
    public struct Box

                    <h3 id="record">record</h3>
                    <p>A <code>record</code> provides all the same functionality of a class with some notable differences. It is a
                        <a href="#Reference_type">reference type</a> with <a href="#Value_type">value type</a> equality. Two record variables are equal if their
                        definitions are identical and all field and property values are the same. A record also provides <i>positional syntax</i> for declaring
                        <a href="#Properties">properties</a> through the use of <i>positional parameters</i>. The compiler then automatically creates a
                        <a href="#Access_modifiers">public</a> auto-implemented property with an <code>init</code> setter for each parameter and a prime
                        <a href="#Constructors">constructor</a> that sets the properties from those parameters. It provides nondestructive mutation through use of the
                        <code>with</code> keyword and a destructor method that makes available for use, all properties created using the positional parameters. It also
                        provides a <code>ToString</code> method that returns the identifier of the record type and all public properties and their values.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the main purpose of a record is to create immutable data, you can declare and provide your own implementation of the auto-implemented
                        by using the same identifiers as those of the positional parameters. This allows you to change accessibility, property accessor mutability or
                        provide your own accessor implementation. Additionally, the prime constructor can be overloaded using the <code>this</code>
                        keyword. In both of these cases you then need to set the property values using the values of the positional parameters.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates how to declare and use records.</p>
<pre><code>    namespace Records

                    <h3 id="delegate">delegate</h3>
                    <p>A delegate allows you to create a reference to a method that can then be passed as a parameter. It does this by declaring the
                        <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">signature</a> of the method which in this case includes the return type. It is declared using an
                        optional <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, followed by the <code>delegate</code> keyword, then the <i>return type</i>, then an
                        identifier that is unique within the <a href="#Dependencies_and_Namespaces">namespace</a>, followed by a pair of round brackets that can
                        optionally contain <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">parameters.</a> Delegates are created using the delegate's identifier,
                        followed by an identifier unique within the local scope and then assigning it a named method which can be either an instance or static. This can
                        then be used to invoke the method as if it was called directly. The <code>delegate</code> keyword can also be used as an operator to create
                        <a href="#Anonymous_functions">anonymous methods</a> that don't require the declaration of a named method for assignment.</p>
                    <p>A common use for delegates is in <a href="#Events">events</a> in which a method known as an <i>event handler</i> is invoked by a special kind of

                    <p>Inheritance is one of the main concepts in Object Oriented Programming. It allows you to create a parent type with common features that multiple
                        different child types can inherit and expand upon. In C# a parent type is called a base type, a child a derived type and
                        <a href="#class">classes</a>, <a href="#record">records</a> and <a href="#interface">interfaces</a> can be inherited. C# only allows
                        single inheritance, that is a derived type can only inherit from one base type but it does allow for multiple generations which means a base
                        type can be inherited by a second which in turn can inherited by a third and so on. As a result, members that are in the base type will be
                        available in each generation of derived types with the following exceptions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Static constructors</li>
                        <li>Instance constructors</li>
                        <li>Finalizers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Events can only be invoked from within the type they are declared so to <a href="#Raising_base_class_events_in_a_derived_class">raise a base type
                        event from a derived type</a> a common pattern is to declare a method in the base type that can be called from the derived type to invoke the
                        event. The availability of all other members in a derived type is dependent on the <a href="#Scope_and_Modifiers">accessibility</a> of a member in
                        the base type. Where members in both a base and derived type have the same identifier, where neither are marked as either virtual or override and
                        where the member in the base type has an accessibility modifier other than private, the derived member will hide the base member. The two members
                        don't have to be of the same type or have the same <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">signature.</a> For example, a property in a
                        base type can be hidden by a method. Access to a hidden member can still be obtained through use of the <a href="#base_keyword">base</a> keyword.
                        When a member is hidden the code editor will indicate this on the hiding member in the derived type with a <u class="warning">warning</u>. This
                        can be removed by marking the member with the <code>new</code> keyword. A class that is marked as <a href="#static">static</a> or
                        <a href="#sealed">sealed</a> can't be inherited.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates the syntax for inheriting a class. First base class <code>A</code> is declared as normal. Derived Class
                        <code>B</code> is then declared followed by a colon, then the identifier of the class to be inherited, followed by the code block for
                        <span class="nowrap">class <code>B</code>.</span></p>
<pre><code>namespace InheritanceSyntax
{
    // Base class A is fist declared
    class A { }

    // Derived class B inherits class A
    class B : A { }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>It is important to note that a derived class cannot be made more accessible than a base class. In this next example, base class <code>A</code>
                        does not have an accessibility keyword applied so it will be internal by default. When derived public class <code>B</code> then attempts to
                        inherit internal class <code>A</code> this results in a <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a> Following this base public class <code>C</code>
                        is declared then derived class <code>D</code> inherits <span class="nowrap">class <code>C</code>.</span> Although <code>D</code> is internal by
                        default, this is allowed as <code>D</code> is less accessible <span class="nowrap">that <code>C</code>.</span> Then when public class
                        <code>E</code> inherits <code>D</code>, again there is an error as <code>E</code> is more accessible
                        <span class="nowrap">than <code>D</code>.</span></p>
                    <p>This illustrates that relying on the default accessibility for a class or interface can easily lead to unexpected errors so it is advisable to
                        always use the <code>internal</code> keyword if that is your intention. This is important as the default template provided by Visual Studio does
                        not provide an accessibility keyword so if you see an 'Inconsistent accessibility' error, check that the base class has been declared public.</p>

                    <p>Although constructors cannot be inherited those in the base class are still called after the derived constructor is called but before the enclosed
                        code of the derived class constructor is executed. Additionally, the <code>base</code> keyword can be used in a derived class to call constructors
                        and overridden instance members within the base class. Only those in the immediate base class in the derived class declaration can be accessed.
                        Lastly if a base class is provided with one or more parameterized constructors, then the compiler forgoes providing the default parameterless
                        constructor. As a result, when inheriting such a class you will then need to provide the derived class with at least one constructor with the same
                        signature as one of the constructors in the base class. The constructor in the derived class must call the constructor in the base class by using
                        the <code>base</code> keyword and pass the arguments provided to it on to the base class constructor.</p>
                    <p>In this example <code>BaseClass</code> has a parameterless constructor that writes to the console when it is called, then sets a value in a field
                        called <span class="nowrap"><code>_Field</code>.</span> It also has a parameterized constructor that takes a value which it uses to set
                        <code>_Field</code> and a virtual method <code>GetFieldValue</code> that returns the value of
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>_Field</code>.</span> <code>DerivedClass</code> inherits from <span class="nowrap"><code>BaseClass</code>.</span> It
                        too has a parameterless constructor that writes to the console when it is called, then sets a value in its own field called
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>_Field</code>.</span> It also has a parameterized constructor which first calls its counterpart in the base class
                        through use of the <code>base</code> keyword which requires passing all arguments it receives to the base class. The derived class also overrides
                        <code>GetFieldValue</code> returning its own <code>_Field</code> value and has a method called <code>CallBaseMethod</code> which, using the
                        <code>base</code> keyword, calls <code>GetFieldValue</code> in the base class.</p>
                    <p>In the <code>Program</code> class an instance of <code>DerivedClass</code> is created using the parameterless constructor which results in first
                        the base class then the derived class constructor being called. Then the return value of <code>GetFieldValue</code> followed by
                        <code>CallBaseMethod</code> are written to the console. Next a second instance of <code>DerivedClass</code> is created using the parameterized
                        constructor with the string 'instance 2' passed in and again the return value of <code>GetFieldValue</code> followed by
                        <code>CallBaseMethod</code> are written to the console.</p>
                    <p>The example also declares a class <code>BaseClass2</code> which contains a parameterized constructor. Deriving the class
                        <code>DerivedClass2</code> from <code>BaseClass2</code> without providing a parameterized constructor with the same signature as that of the base
                        class results in a <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a></p>

                    <h3 id="interface">interface</h3>
                    <p>"An interface is a contract" has to be one of the worst explanations as to what an interface is, yet it still persists throughout much of the
                        literature you may find on line, including that of Microsoft's own C# reference. So, what is an interface.</p>
                    <p>Take a computer manufacturer. They can't anticipate every printer, keyboard, mouse, etc, that will be plugged into their devices. To allow for
                        this, the industry as a whole has created a set of specifications of which various devices must adhere to, so that they are compatible. For a
                        keyboard this may be the signals it must produce when a key is pressed, but it is not the computer manufacturer's job to tell the keyboard
                        manufacturer how to make their keyboards. Providing that the specifications are met the keyboard manufacturer is free to design it as they like.
                        An interface works on a similar basis by declaring which members a class or struct will have without saying how they are to be implemented.</p>
                    <p>An interface is created using the <code>interface</code> keyword. The following signature only members can be declared within an interface.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#Methods">Methods</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Members that are not implemented are public by default and access modifiers cannot be applied to them. Additionally, interfaces can contain members
                        that are implemented which is called default implementation. These are</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Explicit access modifiers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An interface cannot contain an instance field or instance auto-property as an interface cannot have an instance state.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>whilst the declaration of a property in an interface is written with the same syntax as an instance
                        <span class="nowrap">auto-property,</span> it differs in that the compiler does not create an instance backing field.</i></p>
                    <p>Whereas a class can only inherit a single base class it can implement multiple interfaces. This is done in the same manner, i.e., the class
                        identifier is followed by a colon then the identifiers of all interfaces in a comma separated list. If a class also inherits a base class its
                        identifier must come first in the list. A class can also explicitly implement a member of an interface. An interface can be derived from or be the
                        base for by another interface. Implemented members in an interface can be overridden. When this is done explicit interface implementation syntax
                        must be used. Explicitly implemented members and default implemented members in an interface can only be accessed through an instance of the
                        interface.</p>
                    <p>Whilst on the surface an interface may seem to provide much of the same function as an abstract class, the important distinction is that a class
                        can contain a state and so can represent a thing where as an interface cannot and is used to represent a behavior.</p>
                    <p>In the following example the <code>Car</code> class inherits the base class <code>Vehicle</code> and overrides the <code>ApplyBrakes</code>
                        method. The <code>Dog</code> class has a method <span class="nowrap"><code>Speak</code>.</span> Whilst both are quite different objects both are
                        able to move and make a sound and so implement the <code>IMotion</code> and <code>ISound</code> interfaces which respectively include the
                        <code>Move</code> method and <code>Sound</code> property. As can be seen whilst the base class <code>Vehicle</code> must come first in the
                        declaration list, the order of the interface declaration is does not matter.</p>

                        <a href="#Action_and_Func">Action</a> and  <a href="#Action_and_Func">Func</a>, that allow the in-line declaration of an anonymous function

                    <p>Whilst anonymous methods have largely been replaced by lambda expressions, they remain in the C# language for backwards compatibility so are
                        presented here for reference. As with a <a href="#delegate">named method</a> a delegate is first declared with the required return type and
                        <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">signature.</a> The delegate instance is then declared and assigned an anonymous method by using
                        the <code>delegate</code> keyword, followed by the same signature as the delegate, followed by a code block.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates anonymous method declaration and use.</p>

                    <p>Lambda expressions allow for a more concise in-line syntax than anonymous methods. As with a <a href="#delegate">named method</a> a delegate is
                        first declared with the required <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">signature.</a> The delegate instance is then
                        declared and assigned an anonymous method by using a pair of round brackets containing the same signature as the delegate, followed by the lambda
                        operator <code>=&gt;</code>, followed by the lambda body. In most cases both the parameter types and the return type are inferred by the compiler.
                        This means that declaration of parameter types is usually not required but can be included if needed. In any case,
                        inclusion can assist with human readability of the code. Where only one parameter without a type declaration exists, the round brackets become
                        optional. The body can be in two forms, an <i>expression lambda</i> which can consist of an expression or a method call and a
                        <i>statement lambda</i> which consists of a statement block which can contain multiple statements.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates various lambda expression declarations and use.</p>

                    <p>For most project types such as a Console, Windows Forms, WPF programs, etc, these will also include the <i>.NETCore framework</i> which is an
                        extensive library of code that our project will have access to through a reference automatically added by Visual Studio. Under each project in the
                        Solution Explorer is a <i>Dependencies</i> node which when expanded reveals a <i>Frameworks</i> node and under this <i>Microsoft.NETCore.App</i>
                        which is the <i>.NETCore framework</i>. Expanding this reveals many nodes, most of which represent a library (.dll) file prefixed with System.
                        These include types such as the runtime, file access, memory management, collections, etc available to you so that you don't have to create these
                        yourself. In addition to the .NETCore framework a project can have a reference to other projects within the solution and programs external to it.

                    <h3 id="Namespaces">Namespaces</h3>
                    <p>C# requires that each type has a unique identifier. As the number of types increases naming conflicts become ever more probable, particularly when
                        external assemblies are referenced. Namespaces assist with this by compartmentally organizing types in a way that is similar to file system. For
                        example, in order to have two files on a drive called <i>MyFile.txt</i> you may put one in a folder called <i>MyFolder1</i> and the other in
                        <i>MyFolder2</i>. In a command window the two files are then referred to by <i>MyFolder1\MyFile.txt</i> and <i>MyFolder2\MyFile.txt</i>.
                        Namespaces are the same except that the backslashes (or forward slashes) are replaced with a dot. Like a file system, namespaces are hierarchical
                        and a sublevel namespace is known as a nested namespace.</p>
                    <p>A type is defined by its identifier and the namespace it is declared in. Two classes with identical identifiers and members
                        declared in different namespaces are treated as two different types, each identified by their <i>fully qualified</i> name in the form
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>MyNamespace.MyType</code>.</span> Accessing a type in another namespace requires use of its fully qualified name
                        whereas accessing a type in the same namespace only requires its identifier in the form <span class="nowrap"><code>MyType</code>.</span> Nested
                        namespaces are accessed by chaining the namespaces together in the form <span class="nowrap"><code>Namespace1.Namespace2.MyType</code>.</span>
                        Accessible <a href="#static">static</a> <a href="#Members">members</a>, <a href="#Constant_fields">constant fields</a> and nested types within a
                        type are accessed in a similar way in the form <span class="nowrap"><code>MyNamespace.MyType.Member</code>.</span> <i>IntelliSense</i> uses
                        namespaces to assist you by providing suggestions as you type. After typing the root namespace then <span class="nowrap">pressing <b>.</b></span>,
                        all the types and nested namespaces within it will appear in the suggestion box. If one of the nested namespaces is selected,
                        <span class="nowrap">the <b>.</b></span> can again be pressed to find all types and nested namespaces within it and the process can be repeated
                        until no nested namespaces remain. If a type is selected, pressing <span class="nowrap">the <b>.</b></span> will display type's accessible
                        members.</p>
                    <p>The <code>using</code> keyword allows types from another namespace to be <a href="#using_and_importing_types"><i>imported</i></a> into a local
                        namespace so that they can be accessed directly by their identifiers and can also be used to create namespace
                        <a href="#Aliases"><i>aliases</i></a> to avoid naming conflicts. The <code>static</code> modifier keyword can be applied to the <code>using</code>
                        directive to <a href="#Importing_static_members">import static members</a> and nested types. A type declared outside of any namespace is in the
                        <a href="#Global_namespace"><i>global</i></a> namespace. Types that are in the .NetCore library can be imported using the
                        <a href="#Importing_system_types">System namespace.</a></p>

                    <h3 id="namespace">namespace</h3>
                    <p>The <code>namespace</code> keyword followed by a code block is used to declare that all <a href="#Classes_and_Other_User_Defined_Types">types</a>
                        enclosed within it belong to that <i>namespace</i> and can access each other through each type's identifier. Multiple declarations using the same
                        namespace can be made throughout the assembly and don't even have to be in the same file. Two types with the same identifier cannot be declared
                        within the same namespace even if they are declared in different files.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates namespace declaration and usage.</p>

                    <p>When adding a new class using the default class template, Visual Studio automatically puts it within a namespace based on the folder in the project
                        in which the class is added. If you want to use the root namespace instead and want to avoid editing the namespace, add the new class to the root
                        project then move the file to your desired folder. The following shows the code generated by adding a class called <i>MainViewModel</i> to a
                        folder called <i>ViewModels</i> in a project called <i>MyCompany</i>.</p>
<pre><code>namespace MyCompany.ViewModels

    {
    }
}

                    <p>The area outside any namespace declaration in a file is the <i>global namespace</i> and any type declared within it is accessible throughout the
                        assembly. Where two types have the same identifier, a type declared in a local namespace or type will hide a type declared in the global
                        namespace. In this case the global type can still be accessed by prefixing its identifier with the <code>global</code> keyword followed by the
                        <a href="#Namespace_alias_qualifier_operator"><i>namespace alias qualifier</i></a> <code>::</code> in the form

                    <p>The <code>using</code> keyword followed by a <a href="#namespace">namespace</a> identifier creates an import namespace directive. This imports all
                        types from the namespace which can be in any file in the containing assembly or others that the assembly references. Imported types can then
                        be accessed directly by their identifiers as if they were in the same namespace, which makes the code easier to read. Multiple namespaces can be
                        imported into a file but if two or more namespaces each contain a type with the same identifier, attempting to declare a variable of such a type
                        will result in an ambiguous reference error. In this case it will be necessary to use the fully qualified name for each type. A
                        <code>using</code> directive can be placed in either the <a href="#Global_namespace">global namespace</a> or within a namespace but must precede
                        all other code within it. A <code>using</code> directive that is placed in the <a href="#Global_namespace">global namespace</a> makes the types in
                        that namespace available in all other namespaces declared within the same file. A type in a nested namespace is not imported and if a
                        <code>using</code> directive to specifically target its namespace is not included, it will necessary to access its containing types using their
                        fully qualified names.</p>
                    <p>The <code>global</code> keyword can be applied to a using directive. This allows it to be placed in just a single file in an assembly yet allow its
                        types to be imported into all code files within the same assembly. A global using directive can only be placed in the global namespace and must
                        precede all non-global using directives.</p>
                    <p>If you know a type's identifier but don't know its namespace, Visual Studio provides a shortcut for adding this. After entering the type's
                        identifier, with the mouse hovering over it, press <b><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd></b> and IntelliSense will suggest the correct using
                        directive, most likely at the top of the list. Click on the suggestion and it will be added to the code. Please note that the full identifier must
                        be entered with the correct case and the project must have a <a href="#Dependencies">reference</a> to the project containing the type.</p>
                    <p>To remove unused <i>using</i> directives, right click anywhere in the code editor and click <b>Remove and Sort Usings</b></p>

                        allows the static members to be accessed directly without the need for the type's identifier. Instance members that are also in the type will

                    <p>The <code>System</code> namespace and the namespaces nested within it, contain most of the C# built-in types that are part of the
                        .NetCore library. These include primitive value types such as <code>System.Int32</code> and reference types such as <code>System.String</code> and
                        access to these without a fully qualified name requires a <code>using System;</code> directive. Some of the C#
                        <a href="#Keywords">keywords</a> are special built-in <a href="#Aliases">aliases</a> for these types but unlike other aliases, don't require an
                        explicit <code>using</code> directive. For example, the <code>int</code> keyword can be used anywhere in code and is the alias for
                        <code>System.Int32</code>, both of which can be used interchangeably. Other system types such as <code>DateTime</code> which provides many tools
                        to access and manipulate dates and times and <code>Console</code> which has been used extensively throughout this guide, do require an explicit
                        <code>using System;</code> directive or use of their fully qualified names.</p>
                    <p>Nested within <code>System</code> are many other namespaces such as <code>System.Collections.Generic</code> that contains the
                        <a href="#List_T">List&lt;T&gt;</a> and <a href="#Dictionary_TKey_TValue">Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</a> types, <code>System.IO</code> that
                        contains types that allow you to access and manipulate files and <code>System.Threading</code> that provides tools for creating multi-threaded
                        programs. All the namespaces available in the .NetCore library can be viewed under the <a href="#Dependencies">dependencies</a> node in the
                        solution explorer and information about them and the types they contain can be found on the <a href="#References">Microsoft C# reference
                        documentation</a> website.</p>
                    <p>Starting with Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.0, an option called <i>Implicit global usings</i> is available in most of the project templates but not
                        all have this enabled by default when a new project is created. This adds a number of <a href="#using_and_importing_types">global using</a>
                        directives to import various namespaces appropriate to the type of project. These are automatically generated in a file not accessible by the code
                        editor, each time the project is built. This is important as there is currently no easy way to see which using directives are added and this can
                        result in an ambiguous reference error. At the time of this writing the namespaces that are added to a <i>Console App</i> with

                    <p>Scope is the accessibility of a variable from one part of the code to another. In C# scope is arranged like the layers of an onion. Variables in an
                        outer scope can be accessed from those within but not vice versa. In computer science this is known as encapsulation and inner scopes that are
                        contained within outer scopes are said to be nested.</p>
                    <p>A local <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variable</a> is a variable declared in a <a href="#Methods">method</a>,
                        <a href="#Properties">property accessor</a>, <a href="#Indexers">indexer accessor</a>, <a href="#Constructors">constructor</a>,
                        <a href="#Anonymous_functions">anonymous function</a> or operator or one of its nested code blocks. A nested code block includes those of
                        <a href="#if_else_statements">if</a>, <a href="#if_else_statements">else</a>, <a href="#switch_statement">switch</a>,

                        <a href="#try-catch">try</a> and using statements. A <a href="#Parameters">parameter</a> passed into a method, constructor, indexer or operator
                        becomes a local variable within the member. The variable is only accessible after it has been declared and only within the same code block or a
                        nested code block. A local variable within the same block or a nested code block cannot be declared with the same identifier.</p>
                    <p>A local variable can have the same identifier as a member within a container (enclosing type). When this is done the member is hidden by the local
                        variable. To access a hidden member, the <code>this</code> name qualifier keyword must be used. For example if a class contains both a property
                        called <code>someName</code> and a method containing a local variable called <code>someName</code>, to access the property from within the method
                        you would use <span class="nowrap"><code>this.someName</code>.</span> To avoid possible confusion or naming conflicts you should avoid declaring
                        local variables with the same identifier as a member in the same enclosing type. A common convention is to name local variables with
                        <i>camelCase</i>, <code>int someName;</code> private fields with <i>camelCase</i> prefixed with an underscore, <code>int _someName;</code>,
                        private static fields with <i>camelCase</i> prefixed with an 's' followed by an underscore, <code>private static int s_someName</code> and all
                        other members with <i>PascalCase</i>, <span class="nowrap"><code>public int SomeName { get; set; }</code>.</span> Whichever convention you or the
                        team you work for chose, it is important that it be consistent throughout all the code you write.</p>

                    <h3 id="abstract">abstract</h3>
                    <p> An <i>abstract</i> class is used when it makes sense to declare a common base class but where the implementation is specific to each derived class.
                        A base class and its members can be declared abstract by marking them with the <code>abstract</code> keyword. It cannot be instantiated so to be
                        used, a derived class must be created that inherits it and overrides all abstract members it contains. Abstract classes can be inherited by
                        sealed, abstract and non-abstract classes and can inherit from an abstract or non-abstract base class that is not a sealed class. Abstract members
                        cannot declare an implementation and within a derived class are treated the same as a virtual member. Any class that contains an abstract member
                        must be marked with the <code>abstract</code> keyword. An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract members.</p>
                    <p>In the following example an abstract class <code>PriceCalculator</code> is declared with an abstract method called
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>CalculateAmount</code>.</span> Two derived classes that inherit from <code>PriceCalculator</code> are declared. The
                        first <code>ItemsPriceCalculator</code> has two properties, <code>ItemPrice</code> and <code>Quantity</code> and overrides
                        <code>CalculateAmount</code> to return an amount by multiplying these two properties. The second class <code>HoursPriceCalculator</code> has three
                        properties, <code>StartTime</code>, <code>FinishTime</code> and <span class="nowrap"><code>HourlyRate</code>.</span> In this case the overridden
                        <code>CalculateAmount</code> first subtracts <code>StartTime</code> from <code>FinishTime</code> then multiplies thy result by
                        <code>HourlyRate</code> and then returns the amount. Lastly as can be seen, attempting to instantiate <code>PriceCalculator</code> results in a

                    <p>The <code>extern</code> modifier allows a C# program to run code that is implemented in an external library. This could be one of the native code

                        implementation in the external library. The <code>extern</code> modifier is often used with the <code>DllImport</code> attribute which in turn is

                        modifier and <code>DllImport</code> attribute that imports the method implementation from the Windows <i>User32.dll</i> library. When the user
                        presses the <b>x</b> key, an overloaded <code>public</code> <code>MessageBox</code> method is called which in turn calls the

                    <p>The <code>partial</code> keyword allows a class, struct or interface definition to be split across multiple code files. Often this is used to place
                        the boilerplate code of a class into one file and the rest in another.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, within a partial type, a method can also be marked as
                        <code>partial</code> in which case the declaration of the method is placed in one file and the implementation in another, provided that both the
                        declaration and the implementation both start with the <code>partial</code> keyword and both have the same
                        <a href="#Parameters,_signatures_and_overloading">signature.</a> A common use for a partial method is a class designer that automatically declares
                        methods that the developer can then decide whether or not to implement. A partial method's implementation is optional provided it does not have an
                        <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, it returns <code>void</code>, it does not have any <a href="#out">out</a> parameters and it does
                        not have the <a href="#extern">extern</a>, <a href="#new">new</a>, <a href="#override">override</a>, <a href="#sealed">sealed</a> or

                    <p>The following example demonstrates a class called <code>MyClass</code> that is split across two files called <i>MyClass_Part_1.cs</i> which holds
                        the boilerplate code and <i>MyClass_Part_2.cs</i> which holds the business logic. The <code>Program</code> class is able to access the members
                        that are located in the separate files of the instance of <code>MyClass</code> called <code>myClass</code> as normal using
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>myClass.Member</code>.</span> It also has a method called <code>PartialMethod</code> which is declared in
                        <i>MyClass_Part_1.cs</i>, implemented in <i>MyClass_Part_2.cs</i> and which can be accessed in the <code>Program</code> class.</p>

                    <h3 id="static">static</h3>
                    <p>So far, the majority of the examples involve creating an instance of a class by using the <code>new</code> keyword. This
                        allows for multiple instances of a class to be created each with its own initialized state which can be set either by arguments passed in
                        through a constructor or with an object-initializer. Creating an instance of a class in this way is known as instantiation.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you can make a class static by applying the <code>static</code> keyword to the class declaration. Here the class cannot be
                        instantiated but is instead created automatically during runtime and only one instance of it exists. As a static class is not assigned an instance
                        variable identifier it is accessed by its class identifier instead.</p>
                    <p>The following members can also be made static using the static the <code>static</code> keyword.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#Constructors">constructors</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Methods">methods</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Fields">fields</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Properties">properties</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Events">events</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Static members belong to the type and can't be accessed through an instance. Instead, they are accessed through the type by using the type's
                        identifier in the form <span class="nowrap"><code>TypeName.Member</code>.</span> Within
                        a type, instance members can access static members but static members can only access other static members. As with a static class, static members
                        are created automatically at runtime and only one instance of the member exists. This means that if the value of a static member is changed
                        through its type or an instance of that type, then the value will be changed in all instances that contain it. Static fields that do not have
                        initializers and that are not assigned a value in a constructor will be assigned their default values. All members in a static class must always
                        be static.</p>
                    <p> A static constructor can't have access modifiers or parameters and can't be inherited or overloaded, so a type can only have one. It is called
                        automatically at runtime after any static field initializers are executed and before any instances are created or any static members are accessed.
                        A static constructor can't be directly called and a developer can't control when it will be executed.</p>
                    <p>A static method can be useful when it is to perform simple functions that don't have to store or retrieve data from within the class. As it is
                        automatically created at runtime, it can be shared from multiple locations throughout the program without the necessity to create a new instance
                        every time. The .NET <code>System.Math</code> class which contains numerous small math functions is an example of a static class.</p>
                    <p>In the following example, <code>InstanceClass</code> contains both instance and static, fields and methods. Whilst <code>InstanceMethod</code> can
                        access both <code>instanceField</code> and <code>staticField</code>, <code>StaticMethod</code> can only access
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>staticField</code>.</span></p>
                    <p> Next <code>MyClass</code> contains an instance property <code>InstanceProperty</code> and a static property
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>StaticProperty</code>.</span> <code>MyClass</code> also contains methods that can separately set and get the property
                        values. The static property is first set without an instance of <code>MyClass</code> through the use of
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>MyClass.StaticProperty</code>.</span> Next 2 instances of <code>MyClass</code>, <code>myClass1</code> and
                        <code>myClass2</code> are created and when the values of the properties are displayed it can be seen that <code>InstanceProperty</code> has the
                        value 0 and the <code>StaticProperty</code> the value 1. Next <code>myClass1</code> is used to change only the instance property in
                        <code>myClass1</code> has changed whereas the static property in both now has the value 3. This shows you that each instance has its own copy of
                        <code>InstanceProperty</code> whereas both share <span class="nowrap"><code>StaticProperty</code>.</span></p>
                    <p>Lastly the static class <code>MyMathFunctions</code> has the static method <code>SquareNumber</code> which is called directly using
                        <code>MyMathFunction.SquareNumber</code> to display the square of 3.</p>

                        following types can be declared in a namespace <code>class</code>, <code>struct</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>delegate</code>,
                        <code>record</code> and <span class="nowrap"><code>enum</code>.</span></p>
                    <p>The following list shows containing types, which access modifiers can be applied to members and nested types, and the default access levels.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>class or record</i> - <code>public</code>, <code>protected internal</code>, <code>protected</code>,
                            <code>internal</code>, <code>private protected</code>, <code>private(default)</code></li>
                        <li><i>interface</i> - <code>public (default)</code>, <code>protected internal</code>, <code>protected</code>,
                            <code>internal</code>, <code>private protected</code>, <code>private</code>*</li>
                        <li><i>struct</i> - <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>private(default)</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>* A member in an interface that is marked <code>private</code> must have a default implementation.</p>
                    <p>Enum members do not have any declared accessibility and access modifiers cannot be applied to them. An enum member's accessibility  is determined
                        by the accessibility of the enum container type.</p>
                    <p>Even though not required, for code readability and to avoid errors, it is advisable to apply default level access modifiers to types and members.
                    </p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates various accessibility scenarios. It contains two projects. The first is a class library called
                        <i>ClassLibrary</i> that has one file called <i>PublicBase.cs</i> with several classes within the namespace
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>ClassLibrary</code>.</span> The second is an executable called <i>AccessModifiers</i> that has a reference to
                        ClassLibrary and one file called <i>Program.cs</i> with several classes within the namespace
                        <span class="nowrap"><code>AccessModifiers</code>.</span></p>

                <article>
                    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm used extensively throughout C#. It encompasses a number of concepts that provide the
                        developer a structured process for writing a program. This is particularly important for large programs that may be maintained by multiple teams
                        of developers. Instead of having one massive length of code that does everything, it is instead broken down into objects that each have a narrowly
                        defined responsibility. C# uses a sort of template called a type to define an object that is created when a program is run and multiple objects,
                        also called instances, can be created based on the type, each with their own state. These types are then combined to create an assembly and one or
                        more assemblies are combine to create a program.</p>
                    <p> Major principles of OOP include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Object</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation</li>
                        <li>Inheritance</li>
                        <li>Abstraction</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- SECTION Object -->
                    <h3 id="Object">Object</h3>
                    <p>An object combines data and behavior to represent everyday things such as a number, a spreadsheet, a person or even something less tangible such as
                        the relationship between a part's name and its quantity in a database. During runtime multiple objects are created from a type definition each
                        with their own internal state. This allows different versions (instances) of an object to exist. For example, two number type objects could be
                        created, one with a value of 5 and another with 7. Three techniques employed by C# to define an object are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Properties - a particular state of an object such as color, the number of columns, what a thing is made of.</li>
                        <li>Methods - the behavior of an object such as add numbers, manipulate text, etc. Methods can take in and return modified data.</li>
                        <li>Events - a way of communicating to other objects that its state has changed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Take for example a light. It could have a 'Light Is On' property, a 'Turn Light On' method and a 'Light Has Turned' On event. A person object
                        could then check the 'Light Is On' property and if it's off (false), use the 'Turn Light On' method to turn the light on. The method would then
                        set 'Light Is On' to true and then trigger the 'Light Has Turned On' event. A second person object could be watching out for the event and when it
                        happens it would know to run its own 'Read Book' method.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Object -->
                    <!-- SECTION Encapsulation -->
                    <h3 id="Encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>
                    <p>Encapsulation protects the data and methods used to define the internal state of an object from direct manipulation. Data that is passed in and out
                        of the object can be validated so as to ensure that the state of the object becomes invalid. This way code external to an object need not be
                        concerned with the data it contains or how a method works, only that by using it, it will provide the expected result. Take for example the
                        posting of a letter. Provided that you give it the correct address and a stamp, once you place it in the mail box you expect it to arrive at the
                        recipient. You need not be concerned with the details of the method (how it will be delivered) or the internal data (the name of the person doing
                        the delivery). With this the creator of the object is free to change the internal workings of an object without affecting those using it, as long
                        as it continues to do what it says on the box. In order to decide which object members are made available externally to an object, C# provides
                        access modifier keywords such as <code>public</code> and <span class="nowrap"><code>private</code>.</span></p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Encapsulation -->
                    <!-- SECTION Inheritance -->
                    <h3 id="Inheritance">Inheritance</h3>
                    <p>Many things in life have similarities. For example, a car and a motorbike both have an engine, wheels and brakes but whereas a motorbike has
                        handlebars a car has a steering wheel. This makes it difficult to use one object to represent both but rather than create two objects duplicating
                        much of the same functionality we can use the concept of inheritance. Here, first a parent object containing all the common traits is created
                        then separate child objects based on the parent are created, each adding just their own differences. Using the previous example, we could create a
                        vehicle object that has the engine, brakes and wheels properties then from that create a motorbike object that adds handlebars and a car object
                        that adds a steering wheel. By having a common inherited wheels property, the number of wheels can be set at runtime to 2 for a motorbike and 4
                        for car or even 3 if it is a three-wheeler.</p>
                    <p>Other names for parent are ancestor or superclass and for child, descendant or subclass. Just to be different, C# calls a parent a base type and
                        a child a derived type which is specifically mentioned here as C# provides the <code>base</code> keyword to access a base type from a derived
                        type. Also note that structs can neither inherit or be inherited by another class or struct.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Inheritance -->
                    <!-- SECTION Abstraction -->
                    <h3 id="Abstraction">Abstraction</h3>
                    <p>Abstraction is the process of determining and extracting from a complex problem just the information we require to define a solution. For example,
                        what does it take to eat food? Here we need to ask an expert in this case let's consider what a child would say. They'd probably say something
                        like, you  put food in your mouth, chew it then swallow. That's it. Now of course the human body is an extremely complex organism, to actually
                        eat food the brain has to send signals to the jaw muscles to chew the food, then to the tongue to swallow it. From there it goes into the stomach
                        where it is mixed with acid, then into the small intestine ... But for the purposes of survival all the user has to be concerned with is food,
                        mouth, chew, swallow. Of course, had we omitted the chew step then the choke method may have kicked in resulting in a premature end to our
                        program. It is important then to extract exactly what is required, no less, no more and this is an essential design step before the first line of
                        code is even written.</p>
                    <p>Another term you may come across is abstraction layers which is the dividing of a problem into the various layers of complexity. Take for instance
                        what is involved in writing and running a program. As mentioned in the C Sharp Language section all a computer knows is ones and zeroes but even
                        that is not the lowest level. If we go further, we get down to the quantum level where the state of electrons is controlled by transistors. This
                        is the hardware abstraction layer limited mainly to the manufacturer. Above the ones and zeroes, or binary abstraction layer, is the assembly
                        language which is a set of instructions in a pseudo human language provided by hardware manufacturers as to what the hardware does. This is the
                        language used by those creating the compiler that translates the C# language we write into the binary language and ultimately into the quantum
                        state of the hardware. This does not mean that someone writing in C# is completely separated from the other layers. For example, as you use the
                        code editor the compiler is constantly interpreting what you write and if it can't, it will warn you that there is a
                        <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax error.</a></p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Abstraction -->
                    <!-- SECTION Polymorphism -->
                    <h3 id="Polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>
                    <p>Polymorphism is the ability to substitute any child object for its parent and the members they contain. Using the inheritance example, we want to
                        make sure that we can steer our vehicle so we provide a steer method. This presents a problem as we can't be sure whether the consumer is going
                        to buy a car or a motorbike. The car has a steering wheel property that has to be set whereas the motor bike has handle bars. Polymorphism allows
                        you to substitute what the steer method does in the child object. If you then have a purchasing object, that has a buy method that can take in a
                        vehicle object and when it is called, you can substitute the vehicle parent object for either car or motorbike child object. This way whichever is
                        provided will have the correct steer method. </p>
