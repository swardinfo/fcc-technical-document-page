                    <p>The purpose of this guide is to give you an idea of what C# is about and the tools it provides for writing an application. What this is not is a
                        step by step guide into computer programming. Whilst someone with no programming skills may get some benefit, this guide it is aimed at those who
                        have experience with other languages and want to see what C# has to offer.</p>
                    <p>So what do you need to know. Firstly, developing an application in almost any programming language will require some basic maths skills, such as,
                        logical thinking, basic algebra, knowing the difference between integers and floating point numbers, etc. You should also know how to install and
                        upgrade software and operating systems on a computer, and have an internet connection. It would also be useful to know some of the basics of how a
                        computer works such as CPU's, memory, file systems, etc.</p>
                    <p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly is theory of mind, what the user maybe thinking when they use your program.
                        This should be a constant consideration as you create your application. For example, entering a letter in a program when a number is required may
                        be invalid. But then having a popup error message with each wrong keystroke that needs to be cancelled will quickly lead to frustration and your
                        program ending up in the trash.</p>

                    <p>C# is a high level computer language created and maintained by Microsoft for the purpose of developing computer programs. A computer uses binary,
                        the language of ones and zeros. To put it at its simplest all a computer can do is like a light switch turn things on or off, albeit at billions
                        of times a second. For any person trying to write in ones and zeros, this soon becomes an impossible task. A high level programming language is a
                        type of shorthand that is human readable making it easier for a developer to read and write code.</p>

                    <!-- SECTION .NET -->
                    <h3 id="dot_NET">.NET</h3>
                    <p>.NET is an open-source, cross platform framework created and maintained by Microsoft. It provides the <i>Common Language Runtime</i>(CLR) which
                        will run our code and other services such as memory management, debugging, garbage collection, etc, making our job of writing code easier. The
                        phrase <i>during runtime</i>, is often used to refer to the time in which the code is running.</p>
                    <p>.NET also provides a large quantity of pre written code we can use that provides many of the basic functions such as file I/O, network access,
                        collections, user interfaces, etc, so we don't have to write our own. Whenever a console, WinForms or WPF application is created the .NET
                        framework is added by default and can be accessed through the System namespace.</p>
                    <p> The .Net version used throughout this guide is 5.0 and the C# version is 9.0.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>An Integrated Development Environment or <i>IDE</i> is an application that contains various tools that assist the developer to write, run and
                        test a program. The IDE used in this guide is
                        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                        Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019</a>. While Visual Studio has many tools, the three most important are the:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <!-- project requirement -.main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total, not each -->
                        <li>Code editor</li>
                        <li>Compiler</li>
                        <li>Debugger</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The code editor, like a word processor, provides many tools that help in writing code. These include indication of
                        <a href="#Syntax_errors">syntax errors</a> shown with a <u class="error">red wavy underline</u> that may prevent the program from running, and
                        warnings shown with a <u class="warning">green wavy underline</u> that won't stop the program from running but should be addressed. It also
                        provides code auto completion, called IntelliSense in Visual Studio, that provides suggestions with documentation and formatting tools that help
                        keep the code consistent with coding conventions.</p>
                    <p>The compiler is used by C# to convert the code the developer writes into the language the computer requires and using it is known as building the
                        program. On completion, the compiler will report if the result was successful or produce a list of errors that must be corrected before the code
                        can be run.</p>
                    <p>The debugger aids the developer in finding errors in the code. Not every program will be written perfectly first time and the errors that prevent
                        it from functioning correctly are known as bugs. If we were just to write, compile and run the program, then we would not have much to go on as to
                        where a bug may exist. The debugger allows you to step through the code one line at a time to find the problem. This is known as running the
                        program with the debugger attached.</p>
                    <p>At the time of this writing there are three versions of Visual Studio.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community</li>
                        <li>Professional</li>
                        <li>Enterprise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All examples in this document can be created and run on the community version which can be downloaded and installed free from the
                        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Visual Studio</a> web page.</p>

                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>Whilst the code editor in Visual Studio provides color coding for different elements of the code only the
                        <u class="error">red wavy underline</u> used to indicate syntax errors will be shown in this guide.</i></p>

                <article>
                    <p>This guide assumes that the IDE has already been installed, updated and the default settings have not been changed.</p>
                    <p>To create a new project</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start the IDE then click <b>Create a new project</b>.</li>
                        <li> On the <span class="nowrap"><b>Create a new project</b></span> page in the search box at the top type

                        <li>A project template titled <span class="nowrap"><b>Console Application</b></span> should appear at the top of the list. It
                            has an icon that looks like a document with C# in the top right corner. Select <span class="nowrap"><b>Console Application</b></span> then
                            choose <b>Next</b>. (Hint: if <span class="nowrap"><b>Console Application</b></span> is not at the top, click <b>Clear all</b> and search
                            again)</li>
                        <li>On the <span class="nowrap"><b>Configure your new project</b></span> page type <b>'HelloWorld'</b>
                            in the <span class="nowrap"><b>Project name</b></span> box. Leave the <b>Location</b> and <span class="nowrap"><b>Solution name</b></span> as
                            filled in by the IDE and choose <b>Next</b>.</li>
                        <li>In the <span class="nowrap"><b>Additional information</b></span> page make sure <b>.NET5.0(Current)</b> is selected in the dropdown selector
                            then choose <b>Create</b></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The main window of the IDE opens with <i>Solution Explorer</i> open on the right and the code editor on the left. The <i>Program.cs</i> code file
                        should be open in the code editor with the code as per the following example. Not shown here are the line numbers in the left column visible in
                        the code editor. These are not part of the program and are purely for reference.</p>
<!-- Warning, pre and code tags require html to be formatted here which makes it look like crap in the code editor! -->
<pre><code>using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>To run the program press <kbd>F5</kbd>.</p>
                    <p>The console, a <i>command window</i> in Windows, opens displaying the words <b>'Hello World!'</b>. Congratulations, you have now created and run
                        your first C# program. The remainder of the text tells you the program finished but the IDE has kept the console open so that you can see the
                        result. Press any key to close the console.</p>
                    <p>By pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> the compiler built then ran the program with the debugger attached known as running in <i>debug mode</i>. The program
                        starts running at the line <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code>. This is known as the <i>entry point</i> and there are several
                        <a href="#Code_Syntax">code&nbsp;syntax</a> rules it must follow. <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> is also the start of a
                        <a href="#Methods">method</a>.</p>
                    <p>Following <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> is a pair of braces <code>{ }</code> that form a
                        <a href="#Code_Syntax">code block</a>. The program runs or <i>executes</i> all the <a href="#Code_Syntax">statements</a> it finds within these.
                        Statements are executed from top to bottom in the order they appear unless a statement directs execution to another part of the program. Here
                        there is only one, <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>. This tells the computer to write a line followed by a carriage return to the
                        <i>command window</i> and that the text to be written is located within the round brackets <code>( )</code>, which in this case is
                        <span class="nowrap"><b>'Hello World!'</b></span>. As there are no further lines in our code before the closing brace <code>}</code>, the
                        program exits. At this point the window of a program would normally close but the Visual Studio has an option to keep console application windows
                        open so that you can see the results. This option is turned on by default.</p>

                    <p>Some of the terms that will be mentioned in this section have not yet been covered and links are provided to their details, so consider this as a
                        reference to come back to as you become more familiar with them.</p>
                    <p>C# consists of text and symbols each of which tells the compiler how to convert our code into a program. The <i>syntax</i> is the set of rules that
                        governs how our code must be put together, i.e. which word or symbol goes where. Together these words and symbols are combined to form statements,
                        declarations and directives that are the instructions used to create a C# program.</p>
                    <p>First a quick look at the structure of the code which we'll go to into detail throughout this guide. In general a program takes the form of a list
                        of instructions with one per line, though C# allows for an instruction to span multiple lines if required. C# also allows for multiple
                        instructions to be enclosed within a pair of braces <code>{ }</code> (<i>also known as curly brackets</i>) called a <i>code block</i>. A code
                        block can be empty or it can contain any combination of statements, declarations, directives, comments and other code blocks. Each instruction,
                        depending on its type, must be followed by either a code block, a semicolon <code>;</code> or a carriage return. The compiler ignores comments and
                        whitespace other than as separators for words and symbols.</p>
                    <p>There are varying conventions on how to format code. The one used throughout this guide is to place code blocks containing instructions directly
                        under the beginning of the instruction they belong to and indent everything within them. An empty code block may be placed on the same line after
                        the instruction. The IDE has tools to aid with code formatting styles such as this.</p>
                    <p>A statement is the part of the code that becomes the instructions in the program that tells the computer what to do. A declaration instructs the
                        compiler to create a placeholder for an <a href="#Object">object</a> that is to exist and become part of the program. In some cases a declaration
                        can also be a statement. The object must then be initialized if it is a value type or instantiated if it is a reference type before it can be
                        used. A directive is an instruction for the compiler that while not directly part of our program will effect how our program will be built and
                        run.</p>
                    <p>For someone with no experience in C#, reading a list of rules and specifications is likely to lead to more confusion than understanding, so the
                        best way forward is to dive into some examples and see what's going on.</p>
                    <p>The following example illustrates both valid and invalid syntax</p>

</code></pre>
                    <p>In the example above, the first line is a <a href="#Comments_and_Task_Lists">comment</a>. The two forward slashes <code>//</code> at the beginning
                        indicates that this is a single line comment.</p>
                    <p>The line <code>using System;</code> is a using directive and must always end with a semicolon <code>;</code>. The first word <code>using</code> is
                        a reserved word called a <i>keyword</i> in C#. <a href="#Keywords_and_Specifications">Keywords</a> are directly used by the compiler as
                        instructions. The next word <code>System</code> is an <i>identifier</i>. Identifiers are used to name types such as
                        <a href="#Classes_and_Other_User_Defined_Types">classes, interfaces, structs, records,</a>
                        <a href="#Anonymous_functions">delegates,</a> <a href="#Enumerators">enums</a>, <a href="#tuple">tuples</a> and their
                        <a href="#Classes_and_Other_User_Defined_Types">members</a>, and <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variables</a> or
                        <a href="#Namespaces">namespaces</a>.</p>

                    <p>The rules for identifiers are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifiers must begin with a letter or the <code>_</code> character</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can only contain letters, numbers or the <code>_</code> character</li>
                        <li>Identifiers shouldn't contain two or more consecutive <code>_</code> characters as these are reserved for
                            compiler generated identifiers</li>
                        <li>Identifiers are case sensitive</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can only be declared once within the same <a href="#Scope">scope</a></li>
                        <li>A keyword can't be used as an identifier</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By being case sensitive it is valid for two identifiers to differ by case only, e.g. <code><b>n</b>ame</code> and <code><b>N</b>ame</code> are two
                        different identifiers.</p>
                    <p>There may also be situations where using a specific identifier may result in a <i>naming conflict</i> with an identifier in built-in types. In
                        particular all types, even those you define yourself, are provided by .NET with a number of standard <a href="Members">members</a>. Unless these
                        are specifically being overridden the identifiers, <code>Equals</code>, <code>GetHashCode</code>, <code>GetType</code> and <code>ToString</code>
                        should be avoided. </p>
                    <p>More recently C# has introduced the discard variable which is used when the output of an expression is not required. This is an advanced subject
                        that won't be discussed in this guide but is mentioned here for completeness. The identifier for the discard variable is the <code>_</code>
                        character by itself. Unlike other variables, multiple discard variable identifiers can be declared within the same scope.</p>
                    <p><code>namespace MyProgram</code> is a namespace declaration. Namespaces are used to organize objects into logical groups. Details of the
                        <code>using</code> directive and namespaces are in (<a href="#Namespaces_and_References">Namespaces and References</a>).</p>
                    <p>Following the namespace declaration is an opening brace <code>{</code> which is the beginning of a code block and its closing brace
                        <code>}</code> is the last line in the example. All code blocks must have an opening and closing brace. Nested within this code block is a
                        <a href="#class">class</a> as declared by <code>public class MyClass</code> and its associated code block. Nested within this is a
                        <a href="#Constructor">constructor</a> declaration <code>MyClass() { }</code> , a <a href="#Methods">method</a> declaration
                        <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> and their code blocks.</p>
                    <p>There are two main ways in which a program can be compiled for use. The first is as a class library to be used by other applications and the second
                        as an application that can be started directly. For the latter the program must have an entry point method and as mentioned in
                        (<a href="#Create_a_Hello_World_Project">Create a Hello World Project</a>), for C# it is the method <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code>.
                        There are several rules that it must follow but the main ones that are of concern are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There can only be one <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> method within the program</li>
                        <li>It must have the <code> static </code> keyword </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code> , a single line statement, is the first in the <code>public void MyMethod()</code> code block. In
                        this context, the dot <code>.</code> between <code>Console</code> and <code>WriteLine ("Hello World")</code> is called the Member access operator.
                        It allows access to a <a href="">member</a>, here a method called <code>WriteLine</code> in a class called <code>Console</code>. The round
                        brackets <code>( )</code> allow parameters to be passed into the method, here the <a href="#Characters_and_Strings">string</a> literal
                        <code>"Hello World!"</code>. All single line statements must end with a semicolon <code>;</code> . Following are three further examples of single
                        line statements showing how <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variables</a> can be declared and assigned.</p>
                    <p> The <code>while (true)</code> statement also called a <a href="#while_statement">while</a> loop, together with the braces and enclosed code form a
                        code block. No semicolon is required after the closing brace. Within the code block is first an assignment statement, followed by a
                        <code>break</code> statement then another assignment statement. As the <a href="#break">break</a> statement causes the program to leave the while
                        loop before reaching the second assignment statement and, it can't be executed and is known as unreachable code. This won't prevent the program
                        from being built or run but will cause a warning in the the code editor and should be rectified.</p>
                    <p>Next are two <code>if</code> statements. An if statement is a <a href="#Decision_Making_Statements">decision making statement</a>. Some statements
                        allow for a single statement known as an embedded statement, such as <code>x = 1;</code> in the example, to be placed directly after it without
                        the need for braces. Together they form a compound statement so the first two <code>if</code> statements are equivalent. An embedded statement
                        cannot be a declaration or labelled statement so the last <code>if</code> statement example is invalid.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned above, but for a few exceptions, the compiler ignores line breaks, tabs and whitespace, so a statement does not need to be on a single
                        line. <code>Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");</code> can be rearranged to produce the following valid code example as it's the semicolon that
                        instructs the compiler where the end of the statement is. <a href="#keywords">Keywords</a> and identifiers can't contain whitespace or line breaks
                        so the following two examples are invalid. For the remainder of this guide, <i>statement</i> will refer to a statement that ends with a semicolon,
                        even if that statement spans multiple lines.</p>
                    <p>Regular <a href="#Characters_and_Strings">string</a> literals such as "Hello World!" can't contain line breaks so the first string statement
                        example is invalid. Verbatim <a href="#Characters_and_Strings">string</a> literals, prefixed with an <code>@</code> symbol, as in the second
                        example can contain line breaks and produces the result as shown.</p>

                    <p>Comments have several purposes, they provide information to developers as to what the code does and can also aid in debugging. Comments are ignored
                        by the compiler when building the application.</p>
                    <p>Following are some examples of comments.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

namespace Comments
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // This is a single line comment
            int i = 1; // This starts after the statement

            /*
                this is
                    a multi-line comment
                */
            // this is a better way
            // to do a multi-line comment

            // Program execution can be temporarily changed in
            // order to debug and determine where a fault may lie.
            // The following statement will be ignored when the program runs
            // suspectedError++;

            // See the description in the main text on how to comment out
            // multiple lines of code such as the following 3 lines
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

            // TODO: This comment will be added to the tasks list
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Comments can be in two forms. Single line comments start with <code>//</code> and extend to the end of the line. Delimited comments start with
                        <code>*/</code> end with <code>*/</code> and can span multiple lines. For technical reasons that won't be detailed here it is preferred to use
                        multiple single line rather than delimited comments and the code editor has tools that assist with this. To comment out multiple lines, first select
                        all
                        the lines by placing the cursor in front of the first statement, then while pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key, drag the mouse diagonally down to
                        the end of the last statement. Then while still pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> press and release <kbd>K</kbd> then press <kbd>C</kbd> to comment out the
                        selected lines. To uncomment, again with all lines selected, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> then while still pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
                        release <kbd>K</kbd> then press <kbd>U</kbd>.</p>
                    <p>The last comment in the example, <code>// TODO: A task list comment</code>, is interpreted by the code editor as a task to be added to the Task
                        List. There are four predefined task tokens, <code>HACK</code>, <code>TODO</code>, <code>UNDONE</code>, <code>UnresolvedMergeConflict</code> and
                        custom tokens can also be added. Task tokens are not case sensitive. To see the task list, in the menu click <b>View</b> then <b>Task List</b>.

                <article class="main-article">
                    <p>As the program code grows the likelihood that a error will be introduced grows with it. C# provides tools for handling these depending on the kind
                        of error that is encountered.</p>
                    <h3 id="Error_types">Error types</h3>
                    <p>There are three different kinds of errors, syntax errors, runtime errors and logical errors.</p>
                    <h4 id="Syntax_errors">Syntax error</h4>
                    <p>As the title suggests, syntax errors occur when the syntax is wrong and this will prevent the code from being compiled. This could be caused by a
                        spelling mistake, a missing semi colon, an incorrect use of a language element, etc. The code editor will identify such errors with a
                        <u class="error">red wavy underline</u>. These are the easiest errors to fix as in most cases, hovering the mouse over the error will result in a
                        popup dialog in the code editor, identifying the issue along with suggestions on how to fix it.</p>
                    <h4 id="Runtime_errors">Runtime error</h4>
                    <p>A runtime error occurs after the program has been compiled and run. Whilst syntactically correct, when the code is executed it will result
                        in an error that causes the program to crash, most often in the form of an unhandled <a href="#Exception_Handling">exception</a>. As such errors
                        are at a fixed point in the code, these can be usually be fixed fairly easily by either correcting the error through debugging or by providing
                        appropriate <a href="#Exception_Handling">exception handling</a>.</p>
                    <h4 id="Logical_errors">Logical error</h4>
                    <p>These are errors that occur while the program is running but don't cause the program to crash. Instead the program will produce an unexpected
                        result. For example the sum of a list of numbers may be far more than expected because an expression may mistakenly multiplies instead of adding
                        the values. These are often the hardest errors to debug as they most often they result from incorrect assumptions on what the program is doing.
                    </p>

                    <!-- SECTION Exception handling -->
                    <h3 id="Exception_Handling">Exception handling</h3>
                    <p>An <code>exception</code> is an error from which the program cannot recover. C# has a number of built in exceptions that are thrown for various
                        error conditions. Following is an example that shows the result of attempting to divide by zero. By pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> the program will start
                        running in debug mode and then stop and highlight the statement <code>var z = x / y;</code> and display an <i>Exception Unhandled</i> dialog box
                        with the message <i>System.DivideByZeroException: 'Attempted to divide by zero.'</i> of which <code>DivideByZeroException</code> is the exception.
                        To stop the program and clear the exception press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var x = 1;

                    <p>Sometimes you may wish to check for invalid conditions specific to your own program. When these occur you can respond by throwing an exception of
                    your own choice using the <code>throw</code> keyword. You can also include a custom message with the exception. The following throws an
                    <code>ArgumentException</code> with the message <i>y cannot be zero</i>.</p>

                    <p>The try-catch provides a mechanism to safely handle exceptions and consists of a <code>try</code> code block followed by a <code>catch</code>
                        code block. Code that has the possibility of resulting in an exception is placed within the <code>try</code> block and if an exception occurs
                        program execution stops before any further code within the <code>try</code> block is run. Program execution then passes to a catch block that
                        targets the exception. If none is found, program execution passes back to the calling code until an appropriate catch block is found. If a
                        <code>catch</code> block is not found then the program ends with an <i>unhandled exception</i></p>.
                    <p>Following shows how the <code>DivideByZeroException</code> in the previous example could be handled. When run, instead of resulting in an unhandled
                        exception dialog box, <i>Attempted to divide by zero.</i> is written to the console.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

namespace TryCatch

    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = 1;
            int y = 0;
            try
            {
                int z = x / y;
            }
            catch (DivideByZeroException ex)

            }
        }
    }
}

// The example writes the following to the console
// Attempted to divide by zero.
</code></pre>
                    <p>It is important to note that catching exceptions should not be used just to control program flow. In the previous example an
                        <a href="#if_statement">if statement</a> could be used to test the value of <code>y</code> and only allow the division to take place if it is not
                        zero. An example of where a try-catch could be employed is writing to a file as is not possible to test prior whether the action will succeed.</p>

                    <p>It is possible to have multiple catch blocks so as to catch different exceptions. An exception is only caught by the first catch block that
                        can handle it. If there is the possibility that the exception could be caught by more than one, the catch blocks should be ordered most to least
                        specific. In the following example the first block catches the <code>DivideByZeroException</code> and the second <code>Exception</code>
                        catches all exceptions. This means that if <code>DivideByZeroException</code> code block had not been present then the divide by zero exception
                        would have been caught by the <code>Exception</code> code block.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Variables are used to represent data in memory using a symbolic name. Every variable has a <i>type</i> that determines what type of data can be
                        stored and a <i>value</i> which is the actual data. C# is a strongly typed language which means the variable's type must be declared before it can
                        be used and cannot be changed later. The compiler then checks if the value stored in the variable is of the correct type and will tell you if it
                        is wrong. A <i>constant</i> is similar to a variable, except it must be assigned a value when declared and that value cannot be changed. A
                        <i>literal</i> is the representation in code of the data that is assigned to a variable. Variables and constants can only be declared once within
                        the same <a href="#Scope">scope</a></p>
                    <p>C# has two basic categories of variables, the <i>value type</i> and the <i>reference type</i>, into which all variables are grouped. A value type
                        stores its own data where as a reference type stores the address to where its data is located. You can think of these as a house and a contact in
                        an address book. The value type is like the house which has an address and physically stores its own contents where as the reference type is like
                        the contact that only stores the address to where the house is located. .</p>
                    <!-- SECTION Value type -->
                    <h3 id="Value_type">Value type</h3>
                    <p>C# allocates memory based on the smallest size unit of an 8 bit byte. For efficiency reasons, each value type uses a fixed number of bytes. For an
                        integer C# provides a number of options based on size and whether negative values are allowed. The most commonly used is the <i>int</i> which has
                        a memory allocation of 4 bytes or 32 bits and can have negative values. It has a range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. When you write
                        <code>int i = 1;</code> you are telling the compiler to reserve a 4 byte section of memory, that its address will be referred to by the variable
                        with the identifier <code>i</code> and to store the value <code>1</code> in it. But for a few exceptions, operations on one value type variable
                        cannot affect the data of another. A value type variable cannot be changed to refer to data in another memory location.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Value type -->
                    <!-- SECTION Reference type -->
                    <h3 id="Reference_type">Reference type</h3>
                    <p>Providing it is of the same type a reference type can be changed to refer to a different location in memory and its size in memory can change. A
                        reference type can only refer to one location at a time but two reference type variables can refer to the same location. The result is that
                        changing the contents of one will affect the contents of the other.</p>
                    <p>Another important distinction is equality when comparing two variables of the same type. In most cases if the two are value types then they will be
                        equal if the values they contain are the same whereas two reference types will be the same if they both refer to the same location in memory. A
                        notable exception is the <a href="#record">record</a> which is a reference type with value type equality.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> Various type <a href="#Classes_and_Other_User_Defined_Types">members</a> allow the
                        <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">passing in</a> of a variable as an argument. When this occurs, what can happen to the variable
                        depends on whether it is a value or reference type and whether any keywords are present to change this behavior</i></p>
                    <p>C# has a number of built-in types of which each has a dedicated <a href="#Value_type_keywords">keyword</a>.</p>

                    <p>The following applies to variables</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A variable must be declared with a type before it can be used</li>
                        <li>A <a href="#Scope">local variable</a> can only be declared once within the same scope</li>
                        <li>A <a href="#Scope">local variable</a> must be assigned a value before it can be used</li>
                        <li>A variable's type cannot be changed</li>
                        <li>A constant must be assigned a value when declared</li>
                        <li>A constant's type and value cannot be changed</li>
                        <li>A <a href="#Scope">local variable</a> can be implicitly or explicitly declared</li>
                        <li>A <a href="#Access_modifiers">local variable's accessibility</a> cannot be changed with an <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier
                        </a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the following the first few examples demonstrate explicit declaration where you tell the editor what the variable's type is before it is used.
                        The first statement <code>int i;</code> declares the variable <code>i</code> to be a type of integer and then in <code>i = 1;</code> the
                        <code>=</code> <a href="#Assignment_operator">operator</a> assigns the literal value 1 to it. In <code>double j = 2.4</code> both the floating
                        point type <code>double j</code> is declared and the value 2.4 is assigned to it. In <code>int k = i + 3;</code> first the
                        <a href="#Expressions_and_Operators">expression</a> <code>i + 3</code> is evaluated then the resultant value 4 is assigned to <code>k</code>. In
                        <code>const double pi = 3.1415;</code> the constant <code>pi</code> is declared as a type <code>double</code> and is assigned the value 3.1415.
                    </p>
                    <p>C# also allows for <i>implicit</i> declaration through the use of the <code>var</code> keyword. This tells the compiler to determine the type of
                        variable to store based on the expression on the right side of the <code>=</code> operator. In the statement <code>var n = 3;</code> the compiler
                        interprets the 3 as an integer and based on its size assigns <code>n</code> a type of <code>int</code> and the value 3. In
                        <code>var d = 3.0</code> 3.0 is interpreted as a floating point number and <code>d</code> is assigned a type of <code>double</code> with a value
                        <code>3.0</code> . With <code>var x = i + n;</code> summing an <code>int</code> with an <code>int</code> results in an <code>int</code> so
                        <code>x</code> will be an <code>int</code>. In <code>var y = i + d;</code>summing an <code>int</code> with a <code>double</code> will result in a
                        <code>double</code> so <code>y</code> is a <code>double</code>. As can be seen care must be taken when using <code>var</code> as it is easy to end
                        up with a type that was not expected. It should also be mentioned that there is much debate as to the use of the <code>var</code> keyword which
                        will be left for the reader to research.</p>
                    <p>The next eight <code>Console.WriteLine</code> statements write the values of i, j, k, pi, n, d, x and y to the console. Note that the default
                        behavior of <code>Console.WriteLine</code> is to truncate a number if the fractional part is zero so <code>d</code> and <code>y</code> are written
                        as 3 and 4 respectively. The four statements that follow introduce the <code>GetType()</code> <a href="#Methods">method</a>. As the name suggests this method gets the
                        type of the variable supplied. <code>Console.WriteLine</code> then writes these to the console. When run, the program will write the result as
                        shown in the example to the console. For <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> this will be <code>System.Int32</code> and for <code>d</code> and
                        <code>y</code> <code>System.Double</code> where <code>System</code> is a <a href="#Namespaces">namespace</a>. C# has a number of
                        <a href="#Keywords_and_Specifications">keywords</a> for commonly used types. In this example <code>int</code> is the keyword for
                        <code>System.Int32</code> and <code>double</code> the keyword <code>System.Double</code> (note the capital 'D'). Both can be used in code but in
                        general the keyword is favoured by most.</p>

                    <p>Syntax errors that occur when declaring and assigning variables will prevent the application from being compiled. The editor identifies these
                        errors and notifies you by placing a <u class="error">red wavy underline</u> under the part of the statement that is causing them. By moving the
                        the mouse over the line a message will popup detailing the error. Some errors can be quite cryptic so following are a few examples and an
                        explanation of what they mean.</p>
                    <p><i>The name 'p' does not exist in the current context</i> - Before a variable can be used, it must first be declared either explicitly with
                        the use of a type followed by an identifier <code>int p;</code> or implicitly by use of the <code>var</code> keyword <code>var p = 0;</code></p>
                    <p><i>A local variable or function 'i' is already defined in this scope</i> - Only one unique instance of a variable can exist within a
                        <a href="#Scope">scope</a>. As <code>int i = 1;</code> has already declared variable <code>i</code>, the next statement
                        <code>int <u class="error">i</u> = 2;</code> is evaluated by the editor as an attempt to declare a second variable <code>i</code>.</p>
                    <p><i>Cannot use variable 'b' before it is declared</i> - C# executes statements in the order they appear in the code from top down. In this case
                        <code><u class="error">b</u> = 1;</code> has been written above <code>int b;</code>. Reversing the order of these two statements will resolve
                        this error.</p>
                    <p><i>Use of unassigned local variable 'k'</i> - C# requires variables declared within a local <a href="#Scope">scope</a> to be assigned a value
                        before they can be used. Here <code>int k;</code> declares that a variable <code>k</code> of type <code>int</code> but does not assign it a value.
                        When declaring a variable a value can simultaneously be assigned to it through the used of the <code>=</code>
                        <a href="#Assignment_operator">operator</a> as in <code>int k = 1;</code>. Alternatively a variable can be assigned a value after being declared
                        and before being used such as adding <code>k = 1;</code> after <code>int k;</code> and before <code>j = i + k;</code> Note that it is only
                        variables on the right side of the <code>=</code> operator that need to have a value assigned so the use of the <code>j</code> which is declared
                        but not assigned a value on the left side is valid. C# also has has the <code>default</code> keyword which allows any variable to be assigned its
                        default value such as <code>int k = default;</code>.  In this case <code>k</code>  would have a value of 0.</p>
                    <p><i>Cannot implicitly convert type 'double' to 'int'. An explicit conversion exists (Are you missing a cast?)</i> - In all the following cases
                        an attempt is being made to assign a variable of type <code>int</code> a value of type <code>double</code>. C# does not allow the assignment of a
                        value to a variable that could unwittingly result in a conversion that produces a loss of information. By assigning a floating point
                        <code>double</code> to an <code>int</code>, the fractional part after the decimal point could be lost. As can be seen from the examples it may not
                        be obvious at first that a conversion is occurring.</p>

                    <p>A string is a sequence of Unicode (UTF-16) characters that represent text. The maximum length of a string is based on a memory size of 2GB which
                        is approximately 1 billion characters. String literals can be regular or verbatim and/or interpolated. Each can contain zero or more characters
                        enclosed in a pair of double quotes.</p>
                    <p>Regular string literals can contain escaped characters. They can't span multiple lines so to split a statement with a long string literal across
                        two or more lines, each part of the string on each line must first be enclosed in a pair of double quotes. The <code>+</code> concatenation
                        operator is then placed between each string to join them together.</p>
                    <p>Verbatim string literals are prefixed with the verbatim identifier <code>@</code>. Any escaped character will be interpreted verbatim except
                        <code>'\"'</code> which will be interpreted as one double quote. Verbatim string literals can span multiple lines. There must be no white space
                        between the <code>@</code> character and the string.</p>
                    <p>Interpolated strings are prefixed with the interpolation identifier <code>$</code> which indicates that they may contain <i>interpolation
                        expressions</i>. These can contain variables and other special characters that instruct the compiler how to format the string at
                        <span class="nowrap">runtime</span>. Interpolation expressions are wrapped in a pair of braces. There must be no white space between the
                        <code>$</code> identifier and the string. To use a brace as a character in an interpolated string two braces <code>{{</code> or
                        <code>}}</code> must be used. Interpolation expressions include a vast range of options, information of which can be found in the
                        <a href="#References">Microsoft Reference Documentation</a></p>

                    <p>Strings are immutable, that is once created they cannot be changed. C# operators that appear to change a string actually creates a new modified
                        copy of the original string. This means that the performance of a program can suffer when a string is repeatedly manipulated. In these cases
                        C# provides StringBuilder which like a string, also represents a sequence of characters but unlike a string is mutable allowing changes to the
                        sequence. When the operations to the StringBuilder sequence have been completed it can be converted to a string.</p>

                    <h3 id="Array">Array</h3>
                    <p>An array is like a box with separate compartments in which only one item called an <i>element</i> can be stored in each. They can be
                        single-dimensional,  multi-dimensional or jagged and all items must be of the same type. A single-dimensional array is like  one row  of
                        compartments. A multidimensional array can contain rows, columns or more up to a maximum of 32 dimensions. A jagged array is like storing a
                        separate box within each compartment of the first where each one could have its own set of dimensions with different sizes. A jagged array is
                        sometimes called an array of arrays. In addition to the examples shown here C# also provides the <i>Array</i> class which provides a set of
                        methods for manipulating arrays, information of which can be found in the <a href="#References">C# reference documentation</a>.</p>

                    <h3 id="Declaring,_creating_and_initializing_arrays">Declaring, creating and initializing arrays</h3>
                    <p>An array is immutable which means that the number of dimensions and elements or <i>Length</i> of an array must be declared when the array is
                        created and can't be changed. An array can be recreated by using the <code>new</code> keyword which deletes and replaces the existing array
                        <em>and its data</em> with a new one. There are a number of different ways in which to create an array which can also include initializing the
                        element values. If not initialized the default value for the elements in a single-dimensional or multi-dimensional array will be 0 for numeric
                        types and null for reference types. As a jagged array stores other arrays the default type is always null.</p>
                        <p>The following example demonstrates the declaration and initialization of an array.</p>

                    <h3 id="Collections">Collections</h3>
                    <p>.NET provides a number of data structures grouped under the category of collections. They provide common functionality such as to add, remove and
                        modify either individual elements or a range of elements.</p>
                    <p>There are two main types of collections, generic an non-generic. Generic collections take in a type parameter making them type safe at compile time
                        which allows IntelliSense to indicate syntax errors. Non-generic collections store items as type <i>object</i> which requires casting when
                        accessing the data within them. Because of this non-generic collections are less commonly used today and are mostly found in legacy code.</p>
                    <p>Following is a list of some common collection types but only examples of <i>List&lt;T&gt;</i> and <i>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</i>
                        will be discussed in this article.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>List&lt;T&gt;</i> - A collection of items stored by index</li>
                        <li><i>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</i> - Used to store items as key/value pairs</li>
                        <li><i>Queue&lt;T&gt;</i> - Items are accessed first in first out (FIFO)</li>
                        <li><i>Stack&lt;T&gt;</i> - Items are accessed last in first out (LIFO)</li>
                        <li><i>LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</i> - Items are accessed sequentially</li>
                        <li><i>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</i> - Provides notification through events when items are added or removed</li>
                        <li><i>SortedList&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</i> - A sorted collection</li>
                        <li><i>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</i> - A set for mathematical functions</li>
                        <li><i>SortedSet&lt;T&gt;</i> - A sorted set for mathematical functions</li>

                    <h4 id="List_T">List&lt;T&gt;</h4>
                    <p>A <i>List&lt;T&gt;</i> is a strongly typed generic collection of objects accessed by an int type <i>index</i>. Unlike an array, a list does
                        not have a fixed size and as such does not have to be declared. It provides a number of useful methods for manipulating its data such as add,
                        remove, sort, find and clear.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>The Find method uses an anonymous expression details of which are in

                    <p>The <code>enum</code> keyword is used to declare an enumerator which provides a list of named constants. The code editor allows you to use these
                        names to assign the underlying constant values to variables. You can declare the type and value of each constant or allow the editor to declare
                        them for you. The default type for the value is an integer and the list is zero based. A value in an enum is accessed through the enums
                        identifier, followed by a period, followed by the the name of one of the constants. An enum is a value type.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates enumerator declaration and use.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

namespace Enumerators
{
    class Program
    {
        // The default underlying type is an 'int'
        enum Day { Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat }

        // This declares that the underlying month type is declared as 'long'
        enum Month : long { Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var day = Day.Tue;
            var dayType = day.GetType();
            var underlyingDayType = Enum.GetUnderlyingType(dayType);
            Console.WriteLine($"Day is {day}, value is {(int)day}," +
                $" Type is {dayType.Name}, underlying type is {underlyingDayType}");
            var month = Month.Nov;
            var monthType = month.GetType();
            var underlyingMonthType = Enum.GetUnderlyingType(monthType);
            Console.WriteLine($"Month is {month}, value is {(long)month}," +
                $" Type is {monthType.Name}, underlying type is {underlyingMonthType}");
        }
    }
}

// The example prints the following to the console
// Day is Tue, value is 2, Type is Day, underlying type is System.Int32
// Month is Nov, value is 10, Type is Month, underlying type is System.Int64

                    <h3 id="tuple">tuple</h3>
                    <p>A <code>ValueTuple</code> type, commonly called a <i>tuple</i>, is a mutable value type that provides a concise syntax for creating a structure
                        that groups multiple different types together. It does this by creating a <a href="#Access_modifiers">public</a> <a href="#Fields">field</a>
                        element for each type.</p>
                    <p>The tuple syntax is in the from of a set of round brackets containing a comma separated list of at least two <i>elements</i>, with optional
                        identifiers. The compiler provides each element with a default identifier in the form <code>Itemn</code> where n is the position of the element in
                        the list. Optional identifiers are in addition to default identifiers such that an element of a tuple called <code>t</code> can be accessed in the
                        form of either <code>t.Itemn</code> or <code>t.OptionalName</code>. An element can't be optionally named  with a default identifier that is
                        normally used for another element, i.e. naming the the first element <code>Item2</code> results in a syntax error. Additionally, tuples contain a
                        number of <a href="#Members">members</a> and the use of their identifiers will also result in an error. By convention, as the elements are public,
                        they are normally named using <i>PascalCase</i>. Elements can also be assigned values when being declared. A common use for a tuple is the return
                        type for a <a href="#Methods">method</a> where only a single type is allowed, as multiple types can be returned wrapped in the one
                        <code>ValueTuple</code> type.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> If an optional identifier is provided IntelliSense won't provide an option for the default identifier but it can still be entered
                        manually.</i></p>
                    <p>There are a number of different ways to declare and assign values to a tuple as demonstrated in the following example.</p>

            // Implicitly declare a tuple with 2 elements of
            // type string and int and assign values to it.
            var t2 = ("My dog has fleas", true);

            // Explicitly declare a tuple with named elements and assign values to them
            (string Name, int Age) person1 = ("Andrew", 21);

            // The default element name can also be used

                    <p>C# is an <a href="#Object-oriented_Programming">Object-oriented programming language (OOP)</a> and objects can be created using types. A type is a
                        kind of template and when a program runs, objects, also called instances, can be created based on a type. This allows multiple instances to be
                        created each with their own state. Within a C# project, types can be combined with other resources such as media and text files, which are then
                        compiled to create an <a href="#Dependencies_and_Namespaces"><i>assembly</i></a> in the form of either an executable(.exe) or library(.dll) file.
                    </p>
                    <p>The types that can be used to define an object with a state include</p>

                        <li><a href="#record">records</a> are reference types that can behave like a value type and are used mostly with immutable data</li>
                        <li><a href="#delegate">delegates</a> are a type used to represent a reference to a method that can be passed as an argument to another method

                        nested types. Combined these are used to define an object through encapsulation and storage of its data and by providing the object's behavior. A
                        type can contain multiple members with the same identifier, known as <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">overloading</a>, provided
                        that each has a unique <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">signature</a>. Accessibility to a type from code outside of the assembly,
                        and to members both from outside the assembly and from other types within the assembly, is controlled through the use of

                        created, each with its own state. A class can also be made <a href="#static">static</a> in which case it cannot be instantiated using the
                        <code>new</code> keyword but instead a single instance of the class is automatically created at runtime and is shared throughout the assembly. A
                        child class, record or interface can <a href="#Inheriting_types">inherit</a> from a parent class, record or interface respectively. In
                        C# a parent type is called a base type and a child a derived type. Classes and records can be marked as <a href="#abstract">abstract</a> requiring
                        a derived class for instantiation or <a href="#sealed">sealed</a> to prevent inheritance. Use of the static, abstract and sealed keywords is
                        mutually exclusive. As well as inheritance a class, struct or record can implement an interface.</p>

                    <p>The following example defines a <code>Square</code> class with <a href="#Constructors">constructors</a>, <a href="#Methods">methods</a>,
                        <a href="#Fields">fields</a>,
                        <a href="#Properties">properties</a> and <a href="#Events">events</a>. There are two constructors, the first has a
                        <a href="#Parameters_signatures_and_overloading">signature</a> with one parameter and the second with three in which the third parameter is
                        optional. The <code>Program</code> class creates three instances of the <code>Square</code> class. The first uses the first constructor, the
                        second the second constructor without passing an argument to the third parameter. The third also uses the second constructor but does pass an
                        argument. It also adds the <code>Square_AreaChanged</code> event handler to handle the <code>AreaChanged</code> event of both the
                        <code>square2</code> and <code>square3</code> instances. When the program is run, after writing the initial area values to the console it then
                        changes the <code>Width</code> property directly on the <code>square2</code> instance and <code>Height</code> on <code>square3</code> through the
                        <code>SetHeight</code> method. This triggers the <code>AreaChanged</code> event in each which then calls the <code>Square_AreaChanged</code> event
                        handler which in turn writes the updated values to the console.</p>

                    <p>Members are declared within the type that defines the object. All members within an object can access each other irrespective of the location at
                        which they are declared. Access to members external to the object is controlled through the use of
                        <a href="#Access_Modifiers">access modifier</a> keywords and the access level of the object that contains them. If omitted a member's
                        access level will be private by default. Members can also be marked with the <a href="#static">static</a>,

                        an object needs to access a static member of an object in another namespace then the fully qualified name is required in the form of

                        member can optionally be <a href="#override">overridden</a> where as an abstract base member <em>must</em> be overridden by a

                    <h3 id="Methods">Methods</h3>
                    <p>A method provides the behavior of an object. This could be reading a file, calculating a value, writing to the screen, etc. It does this by acting
                        as a container for one or more <a href="#Code_Syntax">statements</a>. Statements elsewhere in the program can pass the execution flow to a method
                        known as <i>invoking</i> or <i>calling</i> a method and statements within a method can call other methods.</p>
                    <p>A method consists of two parts, the <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">signature</a> and the body that contains the statements. The
                        signature defines the methods name, values known as <i>parameters</i> that can be <i>passed in</i> to the method for processing by the statements
                        it contains and a return type for returning a value back to the statement that called it. If a method is not required to return a value then the
                        type is replaced with the <code>void</code> keyword. Optional <a href="#Modifiers">modifiers</a> can be applied to a method and its parameters
                        that can change accessibility and behavior.</p>
                    <p>For a method that returns a value, the statements in the body are executed until a return statement is reached. This is defined by the
                        <code>return</code> keyword followed by a variable or literal of the type in the method declaration followed by a semicolon. Program execution,
                         along with the returned value  will then be passed back to the statement that called the method.</p>
                    <p>For a method that does not return a value, execution will be passed back to the calling statement, either when a return statement or the closing brace is
                        reached. In this case a return statement is defined just with the <code>return</code> keyword followed by a semicolon.</p>
                    <p>In both cases a method can contain multiple return statements allowing for multiple exit points from different paths back to the calling code. In
                        this case, a method that has a return type but that does not have a return statement for all possible paths will produce a syntax error. Methods
                        with a single expression can be implemented in the form of an an <a href="#The_lambda_and_expression-body_definition_operator">expression-bodied
                        member</a> and a class can contain multiple <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">overloads</a> of a method.</p>
                    <p>Access to a method by code external to the type is in the form of <code>instance.Method(parameters)</code> for an instance of a type and
                       <code>TypeName.Method(parameters)</code> for a <a href="static">static</a> type.</p>

                    <h3 id="Constructors">Constructors</h3>
                    <p>When an object is created a constructor is called that can be used to set its data and provide other actions that initialize the object's
                        state. The syntax for a constructor is similar to that of a <a href="#Methods">method</a> in that it has a
                        <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">signature</a> that can take in parameters and is a container for one or more
                        <a href="#Code_Syntax">statements</a>. Unlike a method it cannot return a value, its identifier is always that of the type that contains it and
                        it can only be called once when the object is created.</p>
                    <p>A constructor can be marked with with various <a href="#Modifiers">modifiers</a> that change its behavior and an instance constructor can be
                        <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">overloaded</a>. By using the <code>this</code> keyword, a constructor can call another
                        overloaded constructor when an object is created. In an instance type, if no constructors are declared the compiler will provide a default
                        parameterless constructor with an empty code block. If constructors are declared then the compiler will not declare the default constructor, so in
                        this case if a parameterless constructor is required it will need to be explicitly declared. To create an instance of a type the <code>new</code>
                        keyword is used to call an instance constructor. Constructors with a single expression can be implemented in the form of an an
                        <a href="#The_lambda_and_expression-body_definition_operator">expression-bodied member</a></p>
                    <p>Both instance and static constructors can be declared in <a href="#class">classes</a>, <a href="#struct">structs</a> and
                        <a href="#record">records</a> whereas only static constructors can be declared in an <a href="#interface">interface</a>. A class or record can
                        declare both parameterless and parameterized constructors whereas a struct can only declare parameterized constructors (<em>Note:</em> <i>
                        parameterized constructors will be allowed in structs beginning with C# 10.0</i>). An instance constructor cannot access a field marked static
                        readonly and a static class cannot contain an instance constructor. An instance type can contain a static constructor but a static constructor
                        cannot be used to create an instance of a type.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates the declaration and usage of constructors. The first class called <code>DefaultClass</code> does not explicitly
                        declare a constructor so the compiler declares a default parameterless constructor that can be called to instantiate it.
                        <code>ParameterizedClass</code> explicitly declares a single parameterized constructor. As this prevents the compiler from implicitly declaring a
                        parameterless constructor, when an attempt is made to instantiate the class using one, it results in a syntax error. The <code>Person</code> class
                        has four explicitly declared overloaded constructors. The first is parameterless so creating an instance of <code>Person</code>using a
                        parameterless constructor is permitted and it sets the values of the two <a href="#Fields">fields</a> <code>_firstName</code> and
                        <code>_lastName</code> to <i>First name</i> and <i>Last name</i> respectively. The second constructor has two parameters and sets
                        <code>_firstName</code> and <code>_lastName</code> to the values passed in. The third constructor has one parameter and makes use of the
                        expression-bodied member syntax setting only the value of the <code>_firstName</code> field. The fourth constructor has three parameters,
                        <code>id</code>, <code>firstName</code> and  <code>lastName</code>. Using the <code>this</code> keyword it calls the second constructor, passing
                        in <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> then uses <code>id</code> to set the <code>_id</code> field using expression-bodied syntax.</p>

                    <h3 id="Fields">Fields</h3>
                    <p>A variable declared inside a type but outside any other member is called a field and is used to store data about an object. They are declared using
                        an optional <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, followed by the field's type, followed by an identifier that is unique within the
                        field's containing type. Fields are normally declared either private or protected. This provides <a href="#Encapsulation">encapsulation</a> and
                        access to a field is achieved through other members within the type including <a href="#Properties">properties</a>,
                        <a href="#Methods">methods</a>, <a href="#Indexers">indexers</a> and <a href="#Constructors">constructors</a>. This has the advantage of allowing
                        for data validation and performing other tasks before or after changing its value. Most commonly, external access to a field is through a property
                        and when this is done the field is called a <i>backing field</i>.</p>
                    <p>A variable field does not have to be initialized with a value and if not, will be initialized by the compiler to the default value for its type.
                        When the program is run, field initialization occurs in the order of</p>
                    <p><i>declaration &gt; constructor &gt; object initializer</i>.</p>
                    <p>This means that setting a field's value in a constructor will overwrite a value set in the declaration and setting it's value in an
                        object-initializer will overwrite the value set both in the field declaration, a constructor or an init accessor of a property.</p>
                    <p>A variable field can be made readonly through the use of the <code>readonly</code> keyword in which case it can only be initialized either by
                        declaration or in a constructor. How this effects a variable though depends on whether it is a value or a reference type. As a value type contains
                        its data it can't be changed after being initialized. As a reference type only stores the address in memory of the data, it is only this reference
                        that can't be changed and not the data itself. For example, if a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is declared as a public read-only field, code outside
                        the class can still add and remove items from the list.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> Whilst a <a href="#Strings">string</a> is a reference type as it is immutable declaring it <code>readonly</code> prevents it
                        from being assigned to after initialization.</i></p>
                    <p>By convention fields are normally declared at the top of a class before any other code. Access to a field by code external to the type is in the
                        form of <code>instance.Field</code>.</p>

                    <p>Like a variable field, a constant field is declared inside a type but outside any other member. They are declared using an optional
                        <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, followed by the <code>const</code> keyword, followed by the constant field's type, followed by an

                    <h3 id="Properties">Properties</h3>
                    <p>A property is a way of allowing external code to have controlled access to data within an object. It does this by providing special methods
                        that can read from and write to the data, most often a single field which in this context is known as a <i>backing field</i>. The data the
                        property accesses must be of the same type as the property's declared type. Whilst the
                        default access level for a property is private, an optional <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a> is normally applied to allow for
                        access outside its containing type. Declaration of a property can take one of two forms, <i>manually-implemented</i> or
                        <i>auto-implemented</i>.</p>
                    <p>Manually-implemented properties can be declared using an optional access modifier, followed by the property's type,
                        followed by an identifier that is unique within the property's containing type, followed by a pair of braces that define a code block which is the
                        body of the property. This can contain one or both of two special methods which include a <i>getter</i> declared using the <code>get</code>
                        keyword to read data from the object and a <i>setter</i> declared using either the <code>set</code> or <code>init</code> keywords to write
                        data to the object. Collectively <code>get</code>, <code>set</code> and <code>init</code> are called <i>accessors</i> with <code>set</code> and
                        <code>init</code> being mutually exclusive. A property can be made read/write by using both a getter and a setter, read-only by only using a
                        getter or write-only by only using a setter, though the latter is an extremely rare situation.  </p>
                    <p>Both the getter and the setter each have their own code block. Within the setter code block the <code>value</code> keyword is used to hold the
                        value passed in to the property which is to be assigned
                        to the data, in the form of <code>data = value;</code>. Other statements can be placed in the setter to to
                        validate the value before it is written to the data or to perform an action before or after this is done. This could include
                        <a href="#Events">raising an event</a> to communicate to other objects that the property's value has changed.  Within getter code block  this usually
                         takes the form of <code>return backingField</code>. As
                        with <code>set</code>, other code can also be placed within the <code>get</code> code block. In both cases such code should be limited and where
                        more complex procedures are required a <a href="#Methods">method</a> should be utilized. An alternative to <code>set</code> is <code>init</code>
                        which can only be called by the constructor or an object-initializer, which makes the property read-only after it has been initialized during the
                        objects instantiation. As with <code>set</code> a property can be made write-only by only using <code>init</code>. The <code>set</code> and
                        <code>init</code> keywords are mutually exclusive. Collectively <code>set</code>,
                        <code>init</code> and <code>get</code> are called <i>accessors</i>. An accessor that has a single expression can be implemented in the form of an
                        <a href="#The_lambda_and_expression-body_definition_operator">expression-bodied member</a>.</p>
                    <p>The default access for accessors is that of the property containing them, but can be changed through the use of access modifiers provided
                        that</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the property is read/write</li>
                        <li>only one of the accessors has the access modifier applied</li>
                        <li>the access modifier is more restrictive than the property container</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This means for example, if a property is public and and the <code>set</code> accessor is made private then the property can be read from outside
                         the class but
                         ony set by other members
                        within it. </p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em><i> Applying an access modifier to a <code>get</code> accessor is not recommended and making an <code>init</code> accessor private
                         has the effect that the property can only be initialized in a constructor and <b>not</b> an
                        object-initializer. </i></p>
                    <p>Auto-implemented properties have accessors that are declared without an implementation code block and without declaring a separate  backing field
                        allowing the
                        property to be written with one line of code. During runtime the compiler creates a hidden private backing field that can only be accessed through
                         the
                        property. An advantage of an auto-implemented property is that it can be initialized through the declaration. For a read/write property either
                        both accessors must be manually-implemented or auto-implemented. An auto-implemented property must always have a <code>get</code> accessor so
                        it cannot be write-only.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the order of getters and setters in both manually-implemented or auto-implemented properties doesn't matter, by convention getters are
                        normally declared first. Access to a property by code external to the type is in the form of <code>instance.Property</code> for an instance of
                         a type and
                        <code>TypeName.Property</code> for a <a href="static">static</a> type.</p>

                    <h3 id="Events">Events</h3>
                    <p>An event is a way for a class to communicate with other objects that something within it has occurred. This could be a button click, completion of
                        a task, change of state, etc. The class that <i>raises</i> the event is know as a <i>publisher</i> and the objects receiving the event
                        are known as <i>subscribers</i>. When a publisher declares an event, it in turn allows the declaration of a special type of multicast
                        <a href="#delegate">delegate</a> and provides methods that a subscriber can use to add or remove instances of the delegate. When an event is
                        raised the delegate is then used to invoke a method within the subscriber which in this case is known as an <i>event handler</i>. By being
                        multicast the delegate allows multiple objects to subscribe to the same event or for a subscriber to use the same event handler to handle the same
                        type of event from multiple publishers.</p>
                    <p>Whilst a delegate can declare a signature that defines a return type, a multicast delegate only returns a value from the last event handler that
                        was invoked. For this reason the standard event delegate signature is one that returns void and contains two parameters. The first parameter is an
                        object that refers to the instance that raised the event. The second is a type that can optionally contain event data including values that can be
                        changed in the event handler to effectively supply a return value. A common type for containing event data is one that is
                        <a href="#Inheriting_types">derived</a> from the <code>EventArgs</code> class.</p>
                    <p>C# .NET provides many built-in delegates for use with events which are suffixed with <i>EventHandler</i>. There two most common are
                        <code>EventHandler</code> and <code>EventHandler&lt;TEventArgs&gt;</code>.</p>
                    <p><code>EventHandler</code> is used when the event does not include event data. It declares <code>EventArgs</code> as the second parameter which is
                        set to the <code>EventArg.Empty</code> field when invoking the event.</p>
                    <p><code>EventHandler&lt;TEventArgs&gt;</code> can be used to send event data. Originally it was required that the return data type be derived from
                        <code>EventArgs</code> which is why <i>TEventArgs</i> is still mentioned in much of the online documentation, but that constraint has been removed
                        and any type can now be specified. An <code>EventArgs</code> derived type is still advantageous, particularly where more complex types are
                        employed and for reasons of <a href="#Polymorphism_implementation">polymorphism</a>. If there is a requirement to return a value then a reference
                        type should be used.</p>
                    <p>An event can't be invoked from outside the class that contains it so an additional method is required to call the event. It is common that such a
                        method be marked <code>virtual</code> so they can be <a href="#override">overridden</a> if the class can be inherited. The
                        naming convention for such a method is the name of the event prefixed with <i>On</i> such as <code>OnEvent</code>. The naming convention for
                        subscriber event handlers is the instance or type identifier followed by an underscore followed by the event identifier such as
                        <code>instance_SomeEvent</code>. An event handler can also be in the form of a <a href="#Lambda_Expression">lambda expression</a>.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>When an event has multiple subscribers the order in which they receive the event is not always guarantied. A subscriber should
                        not rely on another having already handled the event.</i></p>
                    <p>In the following example the <code>Clock</code> class declares <code>Started</code>, <code>Stopped</code> and <code>Ticked</code> events and the
                        <code>Program</code> class subscribes and declares event handlers to all of them. The <code>Clock</code> class also declares a <code>Timer</code>
                        instance that provides a continuous <code>Timer.Elapsed</code> event at one second intervals which is handled by a <code>Timer_Elapsed</code>
                        event handler. This in turn calls the <code>OnTicked</code> method that then invokes the <code>Ticked</code> event. When the
                        <code>_clock_Tick</code> event handler in <code>Program</code> is invoked it writes the current time to the console. The
                        <code>Clock.Started</code> event takes a <code>DateTime</code> type which is used to pass the start time to the <code>_clock_Started</code> event
                        handler. The <code>Clock.Stopped</code> event takes a custom type <code>StoppedEventArgs</code> derived from <code>EventArgs</code> which is used
                        to pass the stop time to the <code>_clock_Stopped</code> event handler. <code>StoppedEventArgs</code> has a <code>DateTime</code> type
                        <code>Time</code> property that is set by the constructor. The example also employs <code>Console.ReadKey</code> to test whether the user has
                        pressed the <kbd>enter</kbd> key to end the program.</p>

                    <p>There are situations where you may wish to cancel an event. One such scenario is when closing a program and you want to give the user the
                        opportunity to save unsaved data before this occurs. C# .NET provides the <code>CancelEventHandler</code> delegate to achieve this which passes
                        a <code>CancelEventArgs</code> parameter to the event handler. <code>CancelEventArgs</code> has a bool type property <code>Cancel</code> which can
                        be set in the event handler to indicate if the event should be cancelled.</p>
                    <p>In the following example the <code>ApplicationManager</code> class declares an <code>Exiting</code> event that in turn declares a
                        <code>CancelEventHandler</code> type delegate. The <code>Program</code> class subscribes to the <code>Exiting</code> event and declares an event
                        handler for this using a <a href="#Lambda_Expression">lambda expression</a>. Within the <code>Main</code> method are two while loops, one testing
                        if the user presses the <kbd>x</kbd> key, nested in another that tests if the <code>AllowExit</code> property is true. When the <kbd>x</kbd> key is

                    <p>An indexer allows an object to be indexed like an array. It is similar to a <a href="#Properties">property</a> but also takes an index value to set
                        or get a specific instance. To declare an indexer first an array or collection backing field is declared to store the instances to be indexed. The
                        indexer is then declared using an optional <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, followed by the <code>this</code> keyword, followed by
                        the type of indexer, followed by square brackets that contain one or more indexes separated by commas, with each consisting of the type of index
                        and an index identifier. Accessors are then used to set and/or get the instances from the backing field using the indexes that are passed in. The
                        same rules as as those for read/write and accessibility of properties and accessors also apply to indexers except that an indexer cannot be static
                        and an indexer cannot be auto-indexed. Indexers can be <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">overloaded</a>.</p>
                    <p>Access to an indexer by code external to the type is in the form of <code>instance.Indexer[index]</code></p>
                    <p>The following example declares a string collection which uses an indexer to index instances of itself. The <code>Program</code> class creates a new
                        <code>StringCollection</code> instance, assigns the string "Hello World" to the instance at index 0 in the collection, then retrieves the same and

                    <p>A <i>structure</i> usually referred to by its keyword <code>struct</code> is similar to a class with the following main differences.</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>The static, abstract and sealed modifiers cannot be applied to a struct</li>
                        <li>The readonly modifier can be applied to a struct</li>
                        <li>An instance field or property in a struct can't be initialized when a struct is declared.</li>
                        <li>A constructor in a struct must initialize all instance fields</li>
                        <li>A struct cannot have a parameterless constructor (<em>Note:</em> <i>will be allowed beginning with C# 10.0</i>) </li>
                        <li>A struct cannot have a finalizer</li>
                        <li>A struct cannot inherit or be inherited by a another class or struct</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A struct is normally used to create a basic data type with little or no functionality. Within C# <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>,
                        <code>char</code> and <code>bool</code> are all examples of structs. As a struct is a value type so all instance fields it contains must be
                        assigned a value before it can be used. Although a parameterless constructor can't be declared in a struct, the compiler creates one which sets
                        all instance fields to their default values. This can then use this when instantiating a struct with the <code>new</code> keyword. If all instance
                        fields in a struct are accessible then a struct can be instantiated without using the <code>new</code> keyword. For example an integer can be
                        assigned the value 0 either by <code>int x = new();</code> or <code>int x = 0;</code>.</p>
                    <p>The following example declares a struct called <code>Box</code> with <code>Width</code>, <code>Height</code> and <code>Depth</code> fields and a
                        method called <code>GetVolume</code>. It demonstrates several ways to declare and assign values to a struct and then writes the values to the
                        console.</p>

                    <p>A delegate allows you to create a reference to a method that can then be passed as a parameter. It does this by declaring the
                        <a href="Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">signature</a> of the method which in this case includes the return type. It is declared using an
                        optional <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifier</a>, followed by the <code>delegate</code> keyword, then the <i>return type</i>, then an
                        identifier that is unique within the <a href="#Dependencies_and_Namespaces">namespace</a>, followed by a pair of round brackets that can
                        optionally contain <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">parameters</a>. Delegates are created using the delegate's identifier,
                        followed by an identifier unique within the local scope and then assigning it a named method which can be either an instance or static. This can
                        then be used to invoke the method as if it was called directly. The <code>delegate</code> keyword can also be used as an operator to create
                        <a href="#Anonymous_functions">anonymous methods</a> that don't require the declaration of a named method for assignment.</p>
                    <p>A common use for delegates is in <a href="#Events">events</a> in which a method known as an <i>event handler</i> is invoked by a special kind of

                    <p>Inheritance is one of the main concepts in Object Oriented Programming. It allows you to create a parent type with common features that multiple
                        different child types can inherit and expand upon. In C# a parent type is called a base type, a child a derived type and
                        <a href="#class">classes</a>, <a href="#record">records</a> and <a href="#interface">interfaces</a> can be inherited. C# only allows
                        single inheritance, that is a derived type can only inherit from one base type but it does allow for multiple generations which means a base
                        type can be inherited by a second which it turn can inherited by a third and so on. As a result, members that are in the base type will be
                        available in each generation of derived types with the following exceptions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Static constructors</li>

                        <li>Finalizers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Events can only be invoked from within the type they are declared so to <a href="#Raising_base_class_events_in_a_derived_class">raise a base type
                        event from a derived type</a> a common pattern is to declare a method in the base type that can be called from the derived type to invoke the
                        event. The availability of all other members in a derived type is dependent on the <a href="#Scope_and_Modifiers">accessibility</a> of a member in
                        the base type. Where members in both a base and derived type have the same identifier, where neither are marked as either virtual or override and
                        where the member in the base type has an accessibility modifier other than private, the the derived member will hide the base member. The two
                        members don't have to be of the same type or have the same <a href="#Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">signature</a>. For example a property
                        in a base type can be hidden by a method. Access to a hidden member can still be obtained through use of the <a href="#base_keyword">base</a>
                        keyword. When a member is hidden the code editor will indicate this on the hiding member in the derived type with a
                        <u class="warning">warning</u>. This can be removed by marking the member with the <code>new</code> keyword. A class that is marked as
                        <a href="#static">static</a> or <a href="#sealed">sealed</a> can't be inherited.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates the syntax for inheriting a class. First base class <code>A</code> is declared as normal. Derived Class
                        <code>B</code> is then declared followed by a colon, then the name of the class to be inherited, followed by the code block for class
                        <code>B</code>.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

namespace InheritanceSyntax
{
    // Base class A is fist declared
    class A { }

    // Derived class B inherits class A
    class B : A { }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>It is important to note that a derived class cannot be made more accessible than a base class. In this next example base class <code>A</code>
                        does not have an accessibility keyword applied so it will be internal by default. When derived public class <code>B</code> then attempts to
                        inherit internal class <code>A</code> this results in a syntax error. Following this base public class <code>C</code> is declared then derived
                        class <code>D</code> inherits class <code>C</code>. Although <code>D</code> is internal by default, this is allowed as <code>D</code> is less
                        accessible that <code>C</code>. Then when public class <code>E</code> inherits <code>D</code>, again there is an error as <code>E</code> is more
                        accessible than <code>D</code>.</p>
                    <p>This illustrates that relying on the default accessibility for a class or interface can easily lead to unexpected errors so it is advisable to
                        always use the <code>internal</code> keyword if that is your intention. This is important as the default template provided by Visual Studio does
                        not provide an accessibility keyword so if you see an 'Inconsistent accessibility' error, check that the base class has been declared public.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

namespace InheritanceAccessibility
{
    // Base class A default accessibility is internal
    class A { }

    // Syntax error, derived public class B can't be
    // more accessible than its internal base class A
    //public class B : A { }

    public class C { }

    // This is OK as internal class D is less
    // accessible than public class C
    class D : C { }

    // Syntax error, derived public class E can't be
    // more accessible than its internal base class D
    // even though D inherits from public class C

                    <p>The following example creates a base class called <code>Animal</code> with a public property <code>Legs</code> that provides access to a private
                        field <code>_Legs;</code>. Both classes <code>Bird</code> and <code>Cat</code> inherit and extend the <code>Animal</code> class with
                        <code>Bird</code> adding the property <code>Wings</code> and <code>Cat</code> the property <code>Meowing</code>. In the <code>Program</code>
                        class an instance of <code>Bird</code> is created setting values for both <code>Legs</code> and <code>Wings</code> and an instance of
                        <code>Cat</code> setting values for both <code>Legs</code> and <code>Meowing</code>. A message describing each is then written to the console with

                    <p>An event can only be invoked within the class it is declared. A common pattern to invoke a base class event in a derived class is to declare a
                        virtual method in the base class to invoke the event. This can then be overridden in the derived class where it can be used to indirectly call the
                        base class event. This also allows for additional code to be added and executed within the method before or after the event is raised.</p>

                        a loop. This can be done as <a href="#Polymorphism">polymorphism</a> allows you to substitute a parent for a child then when the parent's method

                    <p>Although constructors cannot be inherited those in the base class are still called after the derived constructor is called but before the enclosed
                        code of the derived class constructor is executed. Additionally the <code>base</code> keyword can be used in a derived class to call constructors
                        and overridden instance members within the base class. Only those in the immediate base class in the derived class declaration can be accessed.
                        Lastly if a base class is provided with one or more parameterized constructors then the compiler forgoes providing the default parameterless
                        constructor. As a result when inheriting such a class you will then need to provide the derived class with at least one constructor with the same
                        signature as one of the constructors in the base class. The constructor in the derived class must call the constructor in the base class by using
                        the <code>base</code> keyword and pass the arguments provided to it on to the base class constructor.</p>
                    <p>In this example <code>BaseClass</code> has a parameterless constructor that writes to the console when it is called, then sets a value in a
                        a field called <code>_Field</code>. It also has a parameterized constructor that takes a value which it uses to set <code>_Field</code>
                        and a virtual method <code>GetFieldValue</code> that returns the value of <code>_Field</code>. <code>DerivedClass</code> inherits from
                        <code>BaseClass</code>. It too has a parameterless constructor that writes to the console when it is called, then sets a value in its own
                        field called <code>_Field</code>. It also has a parameterized constructor which first calls its counterpart in the base class through use of the
                        <code>base</code> keyword which requires passing all arguments it receives to the base class. The derived class also overrides
                        <code>GetFieldValue</code> returning its own <code>_Field</code> value and has a method called <code>CallBaseMethod</code> which, using the
                        <code>base</code> keyword, calls <code>GetFieldValue</code> in the base class.</p>
                    <p>In the <code>Program</code> class an instance of <code>DerivedClass</code> is created using the parameterless constructor which results in first
                        the base class then the derived class constructor being called. Then the return value of <code>GetFieldValue</code> followed by
                        <code>CallBaseMethod</code> are written to the console. Next a second instance of <code>DerivedClass</code> is created using the parameterized
                        constructor with the string 'instance 2' passed in and again the return value of <code>GetFieldValue</code> followed by
                        <code>CallBaseMethod</code> are written to the console.</p>
                    <p>The example also declares a class <code>BaseClass2</code> which contains a parameterized constructor. Deriving the class
                        <code>DerivedClass2</code> from <code>BaseClass2</code> without providing a parameterized constructor with the same signature as that of the base
                        class results in a syntax error.</p>

                        manufacturer how to make their keyboards. Providing that the specifications are met the keyboard manufacturer is free to design it as they like.
                        An interface works on a similar basis by declaring which members a class or struct will have without saying how they are to be implemented.</p>
                    <p>An interface is created using the <code>interface</code> keyword. The following signature only members can be declared within an interface.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Members that are not implemented are public by default and access modifiers cannot be applied to them. Additionally interfaces can contain members
                        that are implemented which is called default implementation. These are</p>

                        <li>Member declarations using explicit interface implementation syntax</li>
                        <li>Explicit access modifiers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An interface cannot contain an instance field or instance auto-property as an interface cannot have an instance state.</p>
                    <p><em>Note:</em> <i>whilst the declaration of a property in an interface is written with the same syntax as an instance
                        <span class="nowrap">auto-property,</span> it differs in that the compiler does not create an instance backing field.</i></p>
                    <p>Whereas a class can only inherit a single base class it can implement multiple interfaces. This is done in the same manner, i.e. the class name is
                        followed by a colon then the name of all interfaces in a comma separated list. If a class also inherits a base class its name must come first in
                        the list. A class can also explicitly implement a member of an interface. An interface can be derived from or be the base for by another
                        interface. Implemented members in an interface can be overridden. When this is done explicit interface implementation syntax must be used.
                        Explicitly implemented members and default implemented members in an interface can only be accessed through an instance of the interface.</p>
                    <p>Whilst on the surface an interface may seem to provide much of the same function as an abstract class, the important distinction is that a class
                        can contain a state and so can represent a thing where as an interface cannot and is used to represent a behavior.</p>
                    <p>In the following example the <code>Car</code> class inherits the base class <code>Vehicle</code> and overrides the <code>ApplyBrakes</code>
                        method. The <code>Dog</code> class has a method <code>Speak</code>. Whilst both are quite different objects both are able to move and make a sound
                        and so implement the <code>IMotion</code> and <code>ISound</code> interfaces which respectively include the <code>Move</code> method and
                        <code>Sound</code> property. As can be seen whilst the base class <code>Vehicle</code> must come first in the declaration list, the order of the
                        interface declaration is does not matter.</p>

                    <p>An anonymous function allows you to create a <a href="#delegate">delegate</a> an assign it a method in one line of code(<i>in-line</i>), without
                        the need for a separate named method. They can be declared with one of two basic syntaxes, <a href="#Anonymous_methods">anonymous methods</a> and

                        <a href="#Action_and_Func">Action</a> and  <a href="#Action_and_Func">Func</a>, that allow the in-line declaration of an anonymous function

                    <p>Whilst anonymous methods have largely been replace by lambda expressions, they remain in the C# language for backwards compatibility so are
                        presented here for reference. As with a <a href="#delegate">named method</a> a delegate is first declared with the required return type and
                        <a href="Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">signature</a>. The delegate instance is then declared and assigned an anonymous method by using
                        the <code>delegate</code> keyword, followed by the same signature as the delegate, followed by a code block.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates anonymous method declaration and use.</p>

                    <h3 id="Lambda_Expression">Lambda expressions</h3>
                    <p>Lambda expressions allow for a more concise in-line syntax than anonymous methods. As with a <a href="#delegate">named method</a> a delegate is
                        first declared with the required <a href="Signatures,_parameters_and_overloading">signature</a>. The delegate instance is then
                        declared and assigned an anonymous method by using a pair of round brackets containing the same signature as the delegate, followed by the lambda
                        operator <code>=&gt;</code>, followed by the lambda body. In most cases both the parameter types and the return type are inferred by the compiler.
                        This means that declaration of parameter types is usually not required but can be included if needed. In any case,
                        inclusion can assist with human readability of the code. Where only one parameter without a type declaration exists, the round brackets become
                        optional. The body can be in two forms, an <i>expression lambda</i> which can consist of an expression or a method call and a
                        <i>statement lambda</i> which consists of a statement block which can contain multiple statements.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates various lambda expression declarations and use.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

            CalculateTwoValues multiply = (int x, int y) =&gt; x * y;

                    <p>A C# project may consist of multiple sources of code along with other other resources such as media and text files which are then compiled to
                        create an <i>assembly</i>. This can be in the form of either an executable (.exe) or library (.dll) file and an application may consist of one or
                        more of these. When multiple assemblies are used, in order for one to be able to access the components of another it must have a reference to it.
                        The reference is a hierarchal such that if assembly A references assembly B then A can access B's components but not vise versa. If B was then to
                        attempt to reference A as well this would cause a circular reference error and would prevent either assembly from compiling. Accessibility of a
                        <a href="#Classes_and_Other_User_Defined_Types">type</a> or type's <a href="#Members">members</a> also depends on the application of
                        <a href="#Access_modifiers">access modifiers</a>.</p>
                    <p>In Visual Studio when a C# project is created it creates a <i>Solution</i> that includes the project and other files required by the compiler to to
                        build the assembly. These can be viewed in the <i>Solution Explorer</i> window which can be accessed via the <i>Solution Explorer</i> tab on the
                        right side of Visual Studio. If the tab is not visible, click on <b>View</b> then <b>Solution Explorer</b> in the menu. The Solution Explorer
                        appears similar to that of tree view of the File Explorer. Under the Solution root node is listed each project and under these each of the files
                        they contain.</p>
                    <p>For most project types such as a Console, Windows Forms, WPF applications, etc, these will also include the <i>.NETCore framework</i> which is
                        an extensive library of code that our project will have access to through a reference automatically added by Visual Studio. Under each project
                        in the Solution Explorer is a <i>Dependencies</i> node which when expanded reveals a <i>Frameworks</i> node and under this
                        <i>Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref</i> which is the <i>.NETCore framework</i>. Expanding this reveals many nodes, most of which represent a library
                        (.dll) file prefixed with System. These include types such as the runtime, file access, memory management, collections, etc available to you so
                        that you don't have to create these yourself. In addition to the .NETCore framework a project can have a reference to other projects within the
                        solution and applications external to it.</p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates how to create a new project, add a second project to the solution of the first and then create a reference of
                        the second project to the first.</p>

                    <p>C# requires that each type has a unique identifier. As the number of types increases naming conflicts become ever more probable, particularly when
                        external assemblies are referenced. Namespaces assist with this by compartmentally organizing types in a way that is similar to file system. For
                        example, in order to have two files on a drive called <i>MyFile.txt</i> you may put one in a folder called <i>MyFolder1</i> and the other in
                        <i>MyFolder2</i>. In a command window the two files are then referred to by <i>MyFolder1\MyFile.txt</i> and <i>MyFolder2\MyFile.txt</i>.
                        Namespaces are the same except that the backslashes (or forward slashes) are replaced with a dot. Like a file system namespaces are hierarchical
                        and a sublevel namespace is known as a nested namespace.</p>
                    <p>A type is defined by its identifier and the namespace it is declared in. Two classes with identical identifiers and members
                        declared in different namespaces are treated as two different types, each identified by their <i>fully qualified</i> name in the form
                        <code>MyNamespace.MyType</code>. Accessing a type in another namespace requires use of its fully qualified name whereas accessing a type in the
                        same namespace only requires its identifier in the form <code>MyType</code>. Nested namespaces are accessed by chaining the namespaces together in
                        the form <code>Namespace1.Namespace2.MyType</code>. Accessible <a href="#static">static</a> <a href="#Members">members</a>,
                        <a href="#Constant_fields">constant fields</a> and nested types within a type are accessed in a similar way in the form
                        <code>MyNamespace.MyType.Member</code>. <i>IntelliSense</i> uses namespaces to assist you by providing suggestions as you type. After typing the
                        root namespace then pressing <kbd>.</kbd>, all the types and nested namespaces within it will appear in the suggestion box. If one of the nested
                        namespaces is selected, the <kbd>.</kbd> can again be pressed to find all types and nested namespaces within it and the process can be repeated
                        until no nested namespaces remain. If a type is selected, pressing the <kbd>.</kbd> will display type's accessible members.</p>
                    <p>The <code>using</code> keyword allows types from another namespace to be <a href="#Importing_types"><i>imported</i></a> into a local namespace so
                        that they can be accessed directly by their identifiers and can also be used to create namespace <a href="#Aliases"><i>aliases</i></a> to avoid
                        naming conflicts. The <code>static</code> modifier keyword can be applied to the <code>using</code> directive to
                        <a href="#Importing_static_members">import static members</a> and nested types. A type declared outside of any namespace is in the
                        <a href="#Global_namespace"><i>global</i></a> namespace. Types that are in the .NetCore library can be imported using the
                        <a href="#Importing_system_types">System namespace</a></p>

                    <h3 id="namespace">namespace</h3>
                    <p>The <code>namespace</code> keyword followed by a code block is used to declare that all <a href="#Classes_and_Other_User_Defined_Types">types</a>
                        enclosed within it belong to that <i>namespace</i> and can access each other through each type's identifier. Multiple declarations using the same
                        namespace can be made throughout the assembly and don't even have to be in the same file. Two types with the same identifier cannot be declared
                        within the same namespace even if they are declared in different files.</p>

                    <p>When adding a new class using the default class template, Visual Studio automatically puts it within a namespace based on the folder in the project
                        in which the class is added. If you want to use the root namespace instead and want to avoid editing the namespace, add the new class to the root
                        project then move the file to your desired folder. The following shows the code generated by adding a class called <i>MainViewModel</i> to a
                        folder called <i>ViewModels</i> in a project called <i>MyCompany</i>.</p>

                    <p>The area outside any namespace declaration in a file is the <i>global namespace</i> and any type declared within it is accessible throughout the
                        assembly. Where two types have the same identifier, a type declared in a local namespace or type will hide a type declared in the global
                        namespace. In this case the global type can still be accessed by prefixing its identifier with the <code>global</code> keyword followed by the
                        <a href="#Namespace_alias_qualifier_operator"><i>namespace alias qualifier</i></a> <code>::</code> in the form <code>global::MyType</code>.</p>

                    <p>Aliases provide a way of resolve naming conflicts which can be of particularly use when importing types from referenced assemblies. They can also
                        result in a much shorter name to use. This is of particular use where access to the type is through many namespace levels. The
                        <code>using</code> keyword is used to create the alias for a namespace or a type.</p>

                    <p>The <code>System</code> namespace and the namespaces nested within it, contain most of the C# built-in types that are part of the
                        .NetCore library. These include primitive value types such as <code>System.Int32</code> and reference types such as <code>System.String</code> and
                        access to these without a fully qualified name requires a <code>using System;</code> directive. Many of the C#
                        <a href="Keywords">keywords</a> are special built-in <a href="#Aliases">aliases</a> for these types but unlike other aliases, don't require an
                        explicit <code>using</code> directive. For example the <code>int</code> keyword can be used anywhere in code and is the alias for
                        <code>System.Int32</code>, both of which can be used interchangeably. Other system types such as <code>DateTime</code> which provides many tools
                        to access and manipulate dates and times and <code>Console</code> which has been used extensively throughout this guide, do require an explicit
                        <code>using System;</code> directive.</p>
                    <p>Nested within <code>System</code> are many other namespaces such as <code>System.Collections.Generic</code> that contains the
                        <a href="#List_T">List&lt;T&gt;</a> and <a href="#Dictionary_TKey_TValue">Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</a> types, <code>System.IO</code> that
                        contains types that allow you to access and manipulate files and <code>System.Threading</code> that provides tools for creating multi-threaded
                        applications. All the namespaces available in the .NetCore library can be viewed under the <a href="#Dependencies">dependencies</a> node in the
                        solution explorer and information about them and the types they contain can be found on the <a href="References">Microsoft C# reference
                        documentation</a> website.</p>

                    <h3 id="Scope">Scope</h3>
                    <p>Scope is the accessibility of a variable from one part of the code to another. In C# scope is arranged like the layers of an onion. Variables in an
                        outer scope can be accessed from those within but not vise versa. In computer science this is known as encapsulation and inner scopes that are
                        contained within outer scopes are said to be nested.</p>
                    <p>A local <a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">variable</a> is a variable declared in a <a href="#Methods">method</a>,
                        <a href="#Properties">property accessor</a>, <a href="#Indexers">indexer accessor</a>, <a href="#Constructors">constructor</a>,
                        <a href="#Anonymous_functions">anonymous function</a> or operator or one of its nested code blocks. A nested code block include those of
                        <a href="#if_else_statements">if</a>, <a href="#if_else_statements">else</a>, <a href="#switch_statement">switch</a>,
                        <a href="#while_statement">while</a>, <a href="#do_statement">do</a>, <a href="#for_statement">for</a>, <a href="#foreach_statement">foreach</a>,
                        <a href="#try-catch">try</a> and using statements. An argument that is passed into a method or indexer is accessible outside the member and
                        becomes a local variable within the member. The variable is only accessible after it has been declared and only within the same code block or a
                        nested code block. A local variable within the same block or a nested code block cannot be declared with the same name.</p>
                    <p>A local variable can have the same name as a member within a container (enclosing type). When this is done the member is hidden by the local
                        variable. To access a hidden member, the <code>this</code> name qualifier keyword must be used. For example if a class contains both a property
                        called <code>someName</code> and a method containing a local variable called <code>someName</code>, to access the property from within the method
                        you would use <code>this.someName</code>. To avoid possible confusion or naming conflicts you should avoid declaring local variables with the same
                        name as a member in the same enclosing type. A common convention is to name local variables with <i>camelCase</i>, <code>int someName;</code>
                        private fields with <i>camelCase</i> prefixed with an underscore, <code>int _someName;</code>, private static fields with <i>camelCase</i>
                        prefixed with an 's' followed by an underscore, <code>private static int s_someName</code> and all other members with with <i>PascalCase</i>,
                        <code>public int SomeName { get; set; }</code>. Which ever convention you or the team you work for chose, it is important that it be consistent
                        throughout all the code you write.</p>

                    <p> An <i>abstract</i> class is used when it makes sense to declare a common base class but where the implementation is specific to each derived class.
                        A base class and its members can be declared abstract by marking them with the <code>abstract</code> keyword. It cannot be instantiated so to be
                        used, a derived class must be created that inherits it and overrides all abstract members it contains. Abstract classes can be inherited by
                        sealed, abstract and non abstract classes and can inherit from an abstract or non abstract base class that is not a sealed class. Abstract members
                        cannot declare an implementation and within a derived class are treated the same as a virtual member. Any class that contains an abstract member
                        must be marked with the <code>abstract</code>keyword. An abstract class can contain both abstract and non abstract members.</p>
                    <p>In the following example an abstract class <code>PriceCalculator</code> is declared with an abstract method called <code>CalculateAmount</code>.
                        Two derived classes that inherit from <code>PriceCalculator</code> are declared. The first <code>ItemsPriceCalculator</code> has two properties,
                        <code>ItemPrice</code> and <code>Quantity</code> and overrides <code>CalculateAmount</code> to return an amount by multiplying these two
                        properties. The second class <code>HoursPriceCalculator</code> has three properties, <code>StartTime</code>, <code>FinishTime</code> and
                        <code>HourlyRate</code>. In this case the overridden <code>CalculateAmount</code> first subtracts <code>StartTime</code> from
                        <code>FinishTime</code> then multiplies thy result by <code>HourlyRate</code> and then returns the amount. Lastly as can be seen, attempting to
                        instantiate <code>PriceCalculator</code> results in a syntax error.</p>

                    <p>The <code>extern</code> modifier allows a C# program to run code that is implemented in an external library. This could be one of the native code

                        implementation in the external library. The <code>extern</code> modifier is often used with the <code>DllImport</code> attribute which in turn is
                        used to import the external library.</p>
                    <p>In the following example <code>extern</code> is used to declare a method called <code>MessageBox</code> which is implemented by a method of the
                        same name in a Windows library called <i>user32.dll</i>. The example also makes use of the <i>local function</i> syntax which wraps the
                        <code>MessageBox</code> method within another called <code>DisplayMessageBox</code>. When the user presses the <kbd>x</kbd> key, a message box is
                        displayed asking the user if they want to end the program which loops until the user clicks the <i>Yes</i> button.</p>

                    <p>So far the majority of the examples involve creating an instance of a class by using the <code>new</code> keyword. This
                        allows for multiple instances of a class to be created each with its own initialized state which can be set either by arguments passed in
                        through a constructor or with an object-initializer. Creating an instance of a class in this way is known as instantiation.</p>
                    <p>In addition you can make a class static by applying the <code>static</code> keyword to the class declaration. Here the class cannot be
                        instantiated but is instead created automatically during runtime and only one instance of it exists. As a static class is not assigned an instance
                        variable identifier it is accessed by its class name instead.</p>
                    <p>The following members can also be made static using the static the <code>static</code> keyword.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#Constructors">constructors</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Methods">methods</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Fields">fields</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Properties">properties</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#Events">events</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Static members belong to the type and can't be accessed though an instance. Instead they are accessed through the type by using the type's
                        identifier in the form <code>TypeName.Member</code>. Within
                        a type, instance members can access static members but static members can only access other static members. As with a static class, static members
                        are created automatically at runtime and only one instance of the member exists. This means that if the value of a static member is changed
                        through its type or an instance of that type, then the value will be changed in all instances that contain it. Static fields that do not have
                        initializers and that are not assigned a value in a constructor will be assigned their default values. All members in a static class must always
                        be be static.</p>
                    <p> A static constructor can't have access modifiers or parameters and can't be inherited or overloaded, so a type can only have one. It is called
                        automatically at runtime after any static field initializers are executed and before any instances are created or any static members are accessed.
                        A static constructor can't be directly called and a developer can't control when it will be executed.</p>
                    <p>A static method can be useful when it is to perform simple functions that don't have to store or retrieve data from within the class. As it is
                        automatically created at runtime, it can be shared from multiple locations throughout the program without the necessity to create a new instance
                        every time. The .NET <code>System.Math</code> class which contains numerous small math functions is an example of a static class.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the following example, <code>InstanceClass</code> contains both instance and static, fields and methods. Whilst <code>InstanceMethod</code> can
                        access both <code>instanceField</code> and <code>staticField</code>, <code>StaticMethod</code> can only access <code>staticField</code>.</p>
                    <p> Next <code>MyClass</code> contains an instance property <code>InstanceProperty</code> and a static property <code>StaticProperty</code>.
                        <code>MyClass</code> also contains methods that can separately set and get the property values. The static property is first set without
                        an instance of <code>MyClass</code> through the use of <code>MyClass.StaticProperty</code>. Next 2 instances of <code>MyClass</code>,
                        <code>myClass1</code> and <code>myClass2</code> are created and when the values of the properties are displayed it can be seen that
                        <code>InstanceProperty</code> has the value 0 and the <code>StaticProperty</code> the value 1. Next <code>myClass1</code> is used to change only
                        the instance property in <code>myClass1</code> has changed whereas the the static property in both now has the value 3. This shows you that each
                        instance has its own copy of <code>InstanceProperty</code> whereas both share <code>StaticProperty</code>.</p>
                    <p>Lastly the static class <code>MyMathFunctions</code> has the static method <code>SquareNumber</code> which is called directly using
                        <code>MyMathFunction.SquareNumber</code> to display the square of 3.</p>

                    <p> Accessibility level declares where a type or type's members can be used by other code within an assembly or other assemblies that reference it.
                        Each type or
                        member has a default access level which, depending on the context, can be changed either by the access level of the container or by the use of an
                        access modifier keyword. A local variable's accessibility is always restricted to the <a href="#Scope">scope</a> in which it is contained and
                        cannot be modified.
                        Except for <code>protected internal</code> and <code>private protected</code> only one access modifier keyword can be applied to a type or a
                        member. For information about accessibility of the accessors for properties see <a href="#Properties">Properties</a> and for indexers see
                        <a href="#Indexers">Indexers</a>. Following is the list of access modifier keywords and the access level provided by them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>public</i> - the same assembly or another assembly that references it</li>
                        <li><i>protected internal</i> - the same assembly or in a derived class in another assembly</li>
                        <li><i>protected</i> - the same class or a derived class in the same or another assembly</li>
                        <li><i>internal</i> - the same assembly only</li>
                        <li><i>private protected</i> - the same class or a derived class in the same assembly only</li>
                        <li><i>private</i> - the same class or a derived class nested within a base class only</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Types declared directly within a namespace (i.e. not nested), can only be declared public or internal where internal is the default level. The
                        following types can be be declared in a namespace <code>class</code>, <code>struct</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>delegate</code>,
                        <code>record</code> and <code>enum</code>.</p>
                    <p>The following list shows containing types, which access modifiers can be applied to members and nested types, and the default access levels.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>class or record</i> - <code>public</code>, <code>protected internal</code>, <code>protected</code>,
                            <code>internal</code>, <code>private protected</code>, <code>private(default)</code></li>
                        <li><i>interface</i> - <code>public (default)</code>, <code>protected internal</code>, <code>protected</code>,
                            <code>internal</code>, <code>private protected</code>, <code>private</code>*</li>
                        <li><i>struct</i> - <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>private(default)</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>* A member in an interface that is marked <code>private</code> must have a default implementation.</p>
                    <p>Enum members do not have any declared accessibility and access modifiers cannot be applied to them. An enum member's accessibility  is determined
                        by the accessibility of the enum container type.</p>
                    <p>Even though not required, for code readability and to avoid errors, it is advisable to apply default level access modifiers to types and members.
                    </p>
                    <p>The following example demonstrates various accessibility scenarios. It contains two projects. The first is a class library called
                        <i>ClassLibrary</i> that has one file called <i>PublicBase.cs</i> with several classes within the namespace <code>ClassLibrary</code>. The second
                        is an executable called <i>AccessModifiers</i> that has a reference to ClassLibrary and one file called <i>Program.cs</i> with several classes

                <article>
                    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm used extensively throughout C#. It encompasses a number of concepts that provide the
                        developer a structured process for writing a program. This is particularly important for large applications that may be maintained by multiple
                        teams of developers. Instead of having one massive length of code that does everything, it is instead broken down into objects that each have a
                        narrowly defined responsibility. C# uses a sort of template called a type to define an object that is created when a program is run and multiple
                        objects, also called instances, can be created based on the type, each with their own state. These types are then combined to create an assembly
                        and one or more assemblies are combine to create an application.</p>
                    <p> Major principles of OOP include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Object</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation</li>
                        <li>Inheritance</li>
                        <li>Abstraction</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- SECTION Object -->
                    <h3 id="Object">Object</h3>
                    <p>An object combines data and behavior to represent everyday things such as a number, a spreadsheet, a person or even something less tangible such as
                        the relationship between a part's name and its quantity in a database. During runtime multiple objects are created from a type definition each
                        with their own own internal state. This allows different versions (instances) of an object to exist. For example two number type objects could be
                        created, one with a value of 5 and another with 7. Three techniques employed by C# to define an object are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Properties - a particular state of an object such as color, the number of columns, what a thing is made of.</li>
                        <li>Methods - the behavior of an object such as add numbers, manipulate text, etc. Methods can take in and return modified data.</li>
                        <li>Events - a way of communicating to other objects that its state has changed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Take for example a light. It could have a 'Light Is On' property, a 'Turn Light On' method and a 'Light Has Turned' On event. A person object
                        could then check the 'Light Is On' property and if it's off (false), use the 'Turn Light On' method to turn the light on. The method would then
                        set 'Light Is On' to true and then trigger the 'Light Has Turned On' event. A second person object could be watching out for the event and when it
                        happens it would know to run its own 'Read Book' method.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Object -->
                    <!-- SECTION Encapsulation -->
                    <h3 id="Encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>
                    <p>Encapsulation protects the data and methods used to define the internal state of an object from direct manipulation. Data that is passed in and out
                        of the object can be validated so as to ensure that the state of the object becomes invalid. This way code external to an object need not be
                        concerned with the data it contains or how a method works, only that by using it, it will provide the expected result. Take for example the
                        posting of a letter. Provided that you give it the correct address and a stamp, once you place it in the mail box you expect it to arrive at the
                        recipient. You need not be concerned with the details of the method (how it will be delivered) or the internal data (the name of the person doing
                        the delivery). With this the creator of the object is free to change the internal workings of an object without affecting those using it, as long
                        as it continues to do what it says on the box. In order to decide which object members are made available externally to an object, C# provides
                        access modifier keywords such as <code>public</code> and <code>private</code>.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Encapsulation -->
                    <!-- SECTION Inheritance -->
                    <h3 id="Inheritance">Inheritance</h3>
                    <p>Many things in life have similarities. For example a car and a motorbike both have an engine, wheels and brakes but where as a motorbike has
                        handle bars a car has a steering wheel. This makes it difficult to use one object to represent both but rather than create two objects duplicating
                        much of the same functionality we can use the concept of inheritance. Here, first an parent object containing all the common traits is created
                        then separate child objects based on the parent are created, each adding just their own differences. Using the previous example we could create a
                        vehicle object that has the engine, brakes and wheels properties then from that create a motorbike object that adds handle bars and a car object
                        that adds a steering wheel. By having a common inherited wheels property the number of wheels can be set at runtime to 2 for a motorbike and 4 for
                        car or even 3 if it is a three-wheeler.</p>
                    <p>Other names for parent are ancestor or superclass and for child, descendant or subclass. Just to be different, C# calls a parent a base type and
                        a child a derived type which is specifically mentioned here as C# provides the <code>base</code> keyword to access a base type from a derived
                        type. Also note that structs can neither inherit or be inherited by another class or struct.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Inheritance -->
                    <!-- SECTION Abstraction -->
                    <h3 id="Abstraction">Abstraction</h3>
                    <p>Abstraction is the process of determining and extracting from a complex problem just the information we require to define a solution. For example
                        what does it take to eat food. Here we need to ask an expert in this case lets consider what a child would say. They'd probably say something
                        like, you  put food in your mouth chew it then swallow. That's it. Now of course the human body is an extremely complex organism, to actually
                        eat food the brain has to send signals to the jaw muscles to chew the food, then to the tongue to swallow it. From there it goes into the stomach
                        where it is mixed with acid, then into the small intestine ... But for the purposes of survival all the user has to be concerned with is food,
                        mouth, chew, swallow. Of course had we omitted the chew step then the choke method may have kicked in resulting in a premature end to our program.
                        It is important then to extract exactly what is required, no less, no more and this is an essential design step before the first line of code is
                        even written.</p>
                    <p>Another term you may come across is abstraction layers which is the dividing of a problem into the various layers of complexity. Take for instance
                        what is involved in writing and running an application. As mentioned in the C Sharp Language section all a computer knows is ones and zeroes but
                        even that is not the lowest level. If we go further we get down to the quantum level where the state of electrons are controlled by transistors.
                        This is the hardware abstraction layer limited mainly to the manufacturer. Above the ones and zeroes, or binary abstraction layer, is the assembly
                        language which is a set of instructions in a pseudo human language provided by hardware manufacturers as to what the hardware does. This is the
                        language used by by those creating the compiler that translates the C# language we write into the binary language amd ultimately into the quantum
                        state of the hardware. This does not mean that someone writing in C# is completely separated from the other layers. For example as you use the
                        code editor the the compiler is constantly interpreting what you write and if it can't, it will warn you that there is a syntax error.</p>
                    <!-- !SECTION Abstraction -->
                    <!-- SECTION Polymorphism -->
                    <h3 id="Polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>
                    <p>Polymorphism is the ability to substitute any child object for its parent and the members they contain. Using the inheritance example, we want to
                        make sure that we can steer our vehicle so we provide a steer method. This presents a problem as we can't be sure whether the consumer is going
                        to buy a car or a motorbike. The car has a steering wheel property that has to be set whereas the motor bike has handle bars. Polymorphism allows
                        you to substitute what the steer method does in the child object. If you then have a purchasing object, that has a buy method that can take in a
                        vehicle object and when it is called, you can substitute the vehicle parent object for either car or motorbike child object. This way whichever is
                        provided will have the correct steer method. </p>
