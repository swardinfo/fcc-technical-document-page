                        <p>The purpose of this guide is to give you an idea of what C# is about and the tools it provides for writing an application. What this is not is
                            a step by step guide into computer programming. Whilst someone with no programming skills may get some benefit, this guide it is aimed at
                            those who have experience with other languages and want to see what C# has to offer.</p>

                        <p>So what do you need to know. Firstly, developing an application in almost any programming language will require
                            some basic maths skills, such as, logical thinking, basic algebra, knowing the difference between integers and floating
                            point numbers, etc. You should also know how to install and upgrade software and operating systems on a computer and
                            have an internet connection. It would also be useful to know some of the basics of how a computer works such as CPU's, memory,
                            etc.</p>

                        <p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly you should have skills in theory of mind and empathy i.e. what the user maybe thinking and how they
                            feel. These should be a constant consideration as you create your application. For example, entering a letter in a
                            program when a number is required may be invalid. Having a popup error message with each wrong keystroke that then needs to be cancelled will
                            quickly lead to frustration and your program ending up in the trash.

                    <p><i>Note: The correct title for this section is <b>C# and .NET</b> but has been changed due to technical limitations</i></p>

                    <h3>The C# language</h3>

                    <p>C# is a high level computer language created and maintained by Microsoft for the purpose of developing computer programs.
                        A computer uses binary, the language of ones and zeros. To put it at its simplest all a computer can do is like a light switch
                        turn things on or off, albeit at billions of times a second. For any person trying to write in ones and zeros, this soon becomes
                        an impossible task. A high level programming language is a type of shorthand that is human readable making it easier for a developer to
                        read and write code.</p>

                    <h3>.NET</h3>

                    <p>.NET is an open-source, cross platform framework created and maintained by Microsoft. It provides the <b>Common Language Runtime</b>(CLR) which
                        will run our code and other services such as memory management, debugging, garbage collection, etc, making our job of writing code easier.
                        The phrase <b>'during runtime'</b>, is often used to refer to the time in which the code is running.</p>

                    <p>.NET also provides a large quantity of pre written code we can use that provides many of the basic functions such as file I/O, network
                        access, collections, user interfaces, etc, so we don't have to write our own. Whenever a console, WinForms or WPF application is created
                        the .NET framework is added by default and can be accessed through the System namespace. At the time of this writing the current version
                        is .Net 5.0.</p>

                    <p>The reference documentation for C# and .NET can be found at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp">Microsoft&nbsp;Docs</a>.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>An Integrated Development Environment or <b>IDE</b> is an application that contains various tools that assist the developer to write, run and
                        test a program. The IDE used in this guide is
                        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                        Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019</a>. While Visual Studio has many tools, the three most important are the:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <!-- project requirement -.main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total, not each -->
                        <li>Code editor</li>
                        <li>Compiler</li>
                        <li>Debugger</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The code editor, like a word processor, provides many tools that help in writing code. These include indication of
                        syntax errors shown with a <u class="syntax">red wavy underline</u> that may prevent the program from running,
                        code auto completion, called IntelliSense in Visual Studio, that provides suggestions with documentation and formatting tools
                        that help keep the code consistent with coding conventions.</p>

                    <p>The compiler is used by C# to convert the code the developer writes into the language the computer requires and using
                        it is known as building the program. On completion, the compiler will report if the result was successful or
                        produce a list of errors that must be corrected before the code can be run.</p>

                    <p>The debugger aids the developer in finding errors in the code. Not every program will be written perfectly first time
                        and the errors that prevent it from functioning correctly are known as bugs. If we were just to write, compile and
                        run the program, then we would not have much to go on as to where a bug may exist. The debugger allows us to step
                        through the code one line at a time to find the problem. This is known as running the program with the debugger
                        attached.</p>

                    <p>At the time of this writing the there are three versions of Visual Studio 2019.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community</li>
                        <li>Professional</li>
                        <li>Enterprise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All examples in this document can be created and run on the community version which can be downloaded and installed
                        free from the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                        Visual Studio</a> web page. For the remainder of this document Visual Studio will be referred to as the IDE.</p>

                        <!-- TODO: To be removed -->
                    <p><em>Note:</em> Whilst the code editor in Visual Studio provides color coding for different elements of the code only
                        the red wavy line used to indicate syntax errors will be shown in this guide.</p>

                        The <i>Program.cs</i> code file should be open in the code editor with the code as in <b>Listing 1.1</b>. Not

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

                    Press <kbd>F5</kbd>.


                    <p>The console, a <i>command window</i> in Windows, opens displaying the words <b>'Hello World!'</b>. Congratulations,
                        you have now created and run your first C# program. The remainder of the text tells us our program finished but the
                        IDE has kept the console open so that we can see the result. Press any key to close the console.</p>

                    <p>By pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> the compiler built then ran the program with the debugger attached. The program starts with the
                        method called <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code>. This is known as the <b>entry point</b> and there are
                        several <a href="Code_Syntax">Code&nbsp;Syntax</a> rules it must follow.</p>

                    <p>Following <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> is a pair of curly brackets <code>{ }</code>. The program
                        executes all the statements it finds within these. Here there is only one,
                        <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>. This tells the computer to write a line followed by a carriage
                        return to the <i>command window</i> and that the text to be written is located within the round brackets
                        <code>( )</code>, which in this case is <span class="nowrap"><b>'Hello World!'</b></span>. As there are no further
                        lines in our code before the closing bracket <code>}</code>, the program exits. At this point the window of a program
                        would normally close but the IDE has an option to keep console application windows open so that you can see the results.
                        This option is turned on by default.</p>

                    <p>Some of the terms that will be mentioned in this section have not yet been covered and links are provided to their

                    <p>C# consists of text and symbols each of which tells the compiler how to convert our code into a program. The
                        <b>syntax</b> is the set of rules that governs how our code must be put together, i.e. which word or symbol goes
                        where. Together these words and symbols are combined to form statements, declarations and directives that are the
                        instructions used to create a C# program. For someone with no experience in C#, reading a list of rules and
                        specifications is likely to lead to more confusion than understanding, so the best way forward is to dive into some
                        examples and see what's going on.</p>

</code></pre>
                    <p>First a quick look at the structure of the code which we'll go to into detail throughout this guide. In general
                        a program takes the form of a list of instructions with one per line, though C# allows for an instruction to
                        span multiple lines if required. C# also allows for multiple instructions to be enclosed within a pair of curly
                        brackets (<i>also known as braces</i>) called a <b>code block</b>. A code block can be empty or it can contain
                        any combination of statements, declarations, directives, comments and other code blocks. Each instruction,
                        depending on its type, must be followed by either a code block, a semicolon <code>;</code> or a carriage
                        return. The compiler ignores comments and whitespace other than as separators for words and symbols.</p>

                    <p>There are varying conventions on how to format code. The one used throughout this guide is to place code blocks
                        directly under the beginning of the instruction they belong to and indent everything within them. The IDE has
                        tools to aid with code formatting styles such as this.</p>

                    <p>A statement is the part of the code that becomes the instructions in the program that tells the computer what to
                        do. A declaration tells the compiler that a new object is to exist and become part of the program. In some cases
                        a declaration can also be a statement. A directive is an instruction for the compiler that while not directly
                        part of our program will effect how our program will be built and run.</p>

                    <p>In the example above, the first line is a <b>comment</b>. The two forward slashes <code>//</code> at the beginning
                        indicates that this is a single line comment. Details on comment syntax and its use is in
                    (<a href="#Comments_and_Task_Lists">Comments and Task Lists</a>).</p>

                    <p>The line <code>using System;</code> is a using directive and must always end with a semicolon <code>;</code>. The
                        first word <code>using</code> is a reserved word called a <i>keyword</i> in C#. Keywords are directly used by the
                        compiler as instructions. A list of all keywords can be found in
                        (<a href="#Keywords">Keywords</a>). The next word <code>System</code> is an <i>identifier</i>.
                        Identifiers are used to name types (class, interface, struct, delegate, record or enum) members, variables, or
                        namespaces.
                    </p>

                    <p>The rules for identifiers are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifiers must begin with a letter or the <code>_</code> character</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can only contain letters, numbers or the <code>_</code> character</li>
                        <li>Identifiers shouldn't contain two or more consecutive <code>_</code> characters as these are reserved for
                            compiler generated identifiers</li>
                        <li>Identifiers are case sensitive</li>
                        <li>Identifiers can only be declared once within the same scope</li>
                        <li>A keyword can't be used as an identifier</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By being case sensitive it is valid for two identifiers to differ by case only, e.g.
                        <code><b>n</b>ame</code> and <code><b>N</b>ame</code> are two different identifiers.</p>

                    <p>More recently C# has introduced the discard variable which is used when the output of an expression is not required. This
                        is an advanced subject that won't be discussed in this guide but is mentioned here for completeness. The identifier for
                        the discard variable is the <code>_</code> character by itself. Unlike other variables, multiple discard variable identifiers
                        can be declared within the same scope.
                    </p>

                    <p><code>namespace MyProgram</code> is a namespace declaration. Namespaces are used to organize objects into logical
                        groups. Details of the <code>using</code> directive and namespaces are in
                        (<a href="#Namespaces_and_References">Namespaces and References</a>).</p>

                    <p>Following the namespace declaration is an opening curly bracket <code>{</code> which is the beginning of a code block
                        and its closing bracket <code>}</code> is the last line in the example. All code blocks must have an opening and
                        closing bracket. Nested within this code block is a class as declared by <code>public class MyClass</code> and its
                        associated code block. Nested within this is a constructor declaration <code>MyClass() { }</code> , a method
                        declaration <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> and their code blocks. Details on <b>constructors</b> and
                        <b>methods</b> are in (<a href="#Classes_and_Objects">Classes and Objects</a>).</p>

                    <p>There are two main ways in which a program can be compiled for use. The first is as a class library to be used by
                        other applications and the second as an application that can be started directly. For the latter the program must
                        have an entry point method and as mentioned in
                        (<a href="Create_a_Hello_World_Project">Create a Hello World Project</a>), for C# it is the method
                        <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> . There are several rules that it must follow but the main ones that
                        concern us are</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There can only be one <code>static void Main(string[] args)</code> method within the program</li>
                            <li>It must have the <code> static </code> keyword </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p><code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code> , a single line statement, is the first in the
                        <code>public void MyMethod()</code> code block. In this context, the dot <code>.</code> between <code>Console</code> and
                        <code>WriteLine ("Hello World")</code> is called the Member access operator. It allows access to a member, here a
                        method called <code>WriteLine</code> in a class called <code>Console</code>. The round brackets <code>( )</code>
                        allow parameters to be passed into the method, here the string literal <code>"Hello World!"</code>. All single line
                        statements must end with a semicolon <code>;</code> . Following are three further examples of single line
                        statements showing how variables can be declared and assigned, details of which are in
                        (<a href="#Variables,_Constants,_Types_and_Literals">Variables, Constants, Types and Literals</a>)
                     </p>

                    <p> The <code>while (true)</code> statement also called a while loop, together with the curly brackets and enclosed code
                        form a code block. No semicolon is required after the closing curly bracket. Within the code block is an assignment
                        statement, a <code>break</code> statement which causes the program to leave the while loop and another assignment
                        statement. As the the second assignment statement follows the <code>break</code> statement, it can't be executed and
                        is known as unreachable code. This won't prevent the program from being built or run but will cause a warning in the
                        IDE and should be rectified. Details on while loops can be found in
                        (<a href="#Iteration_Statements">Iteration Statements</a>).
                    </p>

                    <p>Next are two <code>if</code> statements. Details on if statements can be found in
                        (<a href="#Decision_Making_Statements">Decision Making Statements </a>). Some statements allow for
                        a single statement known as an embedded statement, such as <code>x = 1;</code> in the example, to be placed directly
                        after it without the need for curly brackets. Together they form a compound statement. In the example the two
                        <code>if</code> statements are equivalent. An embedded statement cannot be a declaration or labelled statement so
                        the following example is invalid.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned above, but for a few exceptions, the compiler ignores line breaks, tabs and whitespace, so a
                        statement does not need to be on a single line. <code>Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");</code> can be rearranged to
                        produce the following valid code example. It's the semicolon here that instructs the compiler where the end of the statement
                        is. Keywords and identifiers can't contain whitespace or line breaks so the following two examples are invalid.
                        For the remainder of this guide, <b>statement</b> will refer to a statement that ends with a semicolon, even
                        if that statement spans multiple lines.</p>


                    <p>Regular string literals such as "Hello World!" can't contain line breaks so the first string statement example is
                        invalid. Verbatim string literals, prefixed with an <code>@</code> symbol, as in the second example can contain line
                        breaks and produces the result as shown. Details on strings can be found in
                        (<a href="#Characters_and_Strings">Characters and Strings</a>)</p>

                    <p>Comments have several purposes, they provide information to developers as to what the code does and can also aid in
                        debugging. Comments are ignored by the compiler when building the application.</p>

                    <p>Following are some examples of comments.</p>


<pre><code>using System;

namespace CommentExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // This is a single line comment
            int i = 1; // This starts after the statement

            /*
                this is
                    a multi-line comment
                */
            // this is a better way
            // to do a multi-line comment

            // Program execution can be temporarily changed in
            // order to debug and determine where a fault may lie.
            // The following statement will be ignored when the program runs
            // suspectedError++;

            // See the description in the main text on how to comment out
            // multiple lines of code such as the following 3 lines
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

            // TODO: This comment will be added to the tasks list
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Comments can be in two forms. Single line comments start with <code>//</code> and extend to the end of the line.
                        Delimited comments start with <code>*/</code> end with <code>*/</code> and can span multiple lines. For technical
                        reasons that won't be detailed here it is preferred to use multiple single line rather than delimited comments and
                        the IDE has tools that assist with this. To comment out multiple lines, first select all the lines by placing the
                        cursor in front of the first statement, then while pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key, drag the mouse diagonally down
                        to the end of the last statement. Then while still pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> press and release <kbd>K</kbd> then
                        press <kbd>C</kbd> to comment out the selected lines. To uncomment, again with all lines selected, press
                        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> then while still pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> release <kbd>K</kbd> then
                        press <kbd>U</kbd>.</p>

                    <p>The last comment in the example <code>// TODO: A task list comment</code> is interpreted by the IDE as a task to be
                        added to the Task List. There are four predefined task tokens, <code>HACK</code>, <code>TODO</code>,
                        <code>UNDONE</code> and <code>UnresolvedMergeConflict</code>. As well custom tokens can also be added. Task tokens
                        are not case sensitive. To see the task list,  in the menu click View-&gt;Task List.</p>

                    <p>
                        Local variables
                        can be explicitly declared <code>int x = 1;</code> or implicitly declared using the <code>var</code> keyword <code>var x = 1;</code>
                        A local variables accessibility cannot be changed with an access modifier.
                    </p>

                    <p>Variables are used to represent data in memory using a symbolic name. Every variable has a <b>type</b> that
                        determines what type of data can be stored and a <b>value</b> which is the actual data. C# is a strongly typed
                        language which means the variable's type must be declared before it can be used and cannot be changed later. The
                        compiler then checks if the value stored in the variable is of the correct type and will tell us if it is wrong.
                        A <b>constant</b> is similar to a variable, except it must be assigned a value when declared and that value cannot be
                        changed. A <i>literal</i> is the representation in the code we write for the data we assign to a variable.</p>

                    <p>C# has two basic categories of variables, the <b>value type</b> and the <b>reference type</b>, into which all variables
                        are grouped. A <b>value type</b> stores its own data where as a <b>reference type</b> stores the address to where its data
                        is located. You can think of these as a house and a contact in an address book. The <b>value type</b> is like the house
                        which has an address and physically stores its own contents where as the <b>reference type</b> is like the contact that
                        only stores the address to where the house is located. A variable can only be declared once within the same scope, details
                        of which are in (<a href="#Scope">Scope</a>). C# has a number of built-in types of which each has
                        a dedicated keyword.</p>

                    <p>C# allocates memory based on the smallest size unit of an 8 bit byte. For efficiency reasons, each <b>value type</b> uses a
                        fixed number of bytes. In the case of an <b>int</b> that size is 4 bytes or 32 bits. When we use the
                        statement<code>int i = 1;</code> we are telling the compiler to reserve a 4 byte section of memory, that its address will be
                        referred to by the variable with the identifier <b>i</b> and to store the value 1 in it. But for a few exceptions, operations
                        on one value type variable cannot affect the data of another. A <b>value type</b> variable cannot be changed to refer to data
                        in another memory location.</p>

                        <p></p>

                    <p>Following is a list of the built-in <b>value types</b> in C# with the keywords shown in bold.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean: <b>bool</b></li>
                        <li>Signed integer: <b>sbyte, short, int, long</b></li>
                        <li>Unsigned integer: <b>byte, ushort, uint, ulong</b></li>
                        <li>Binary floating-point: <b>float, double</b></li>
                        <li>Decimal floating-point: <b>decimal</b></li>
                        <li>Unicode characters: <b>char</b></li>
                        <li>User-defined type of form enum E {...}</li>
                        <li>User-defined type of form struct S {...}</li>

                    <p>A <b>reference type</b> variable can be changed to refer to a different location in memory providing it is of the same
                        type. Also, the size of a <b>reference type</b> can change. A <b>reference type</b> variable can only refer to one location at a
                        time but 2 <b>reference type</b> variables can refer to the same location. The result is that changing the contents of one will
                        affect the contents of the other.</p>

</code></pre>
                    <p>In <b>Listing 4.1</b> the first statement <code>int i;</code> declares the variable <code>i</code> to be a type of
                        integer and then in <code>i = 1;</code> the <code>=</code> operator assigns the literal value 1 to it. In
                        <code>double j = 2.4</code> both the floating point type double <code>j</code> is declared and the value 2.4 is assigned to it.
                        In <code>int k = i + 3;</code> first the operand <code>i + 3</code> is evaluated then the
                        resultant value 4 is assigned to k. In <code>const double pi = 3.1415;</code> the constant pi is declared as a type
                        double and is assigned the value 3.1415.</p>

                    <p>All the previous statements are examples of explicit declarations where we tell the editor what the variable's type
                        is before it is used. In addition, C# also allows the the variables to be implicitly declared through the use of the
                        <b>var</b> keyword which tells the compiler to determine the type of the variable to store based on the operand on the
                        right side of the <code>=</code> operator. In the statement <code>var n = 3;</code> the compiler interprets the 3 as
                        an integer and based on its size assigns <code>n</code> a type of <code>int</code> and the value 3.  In
                        <code>var d = 3.0</code> 3.0 is interpreted as a floating point number and <code>d</code> is assigned a type of
                        <code>double</code> with a value <code>3.0</code> . With <code>var x = i + n;</code> summing an int with an int results in an int
                        so x will be an int. In <code>var y = i + d;</code>summing an int with a double will result in a double so y is a double. As can be
                        seen care must be taken when using <code>var</code> for as it is easy to end up with a type that was not expected.  It should also
                        be mentioned that there is much debate as to the use of the <code>var</code> keyword which will be left for the reader to research.</p>

                    <p>The next eight <code>Console.WriteLine</code> statements write the values of i, j, k, pi, n, d, x and y to the console. Note that
                        <code>Console.WriteLine</code> truncates a number if the fractional part is zero so d and y are written as 3 and 4 respectively.
                        The four statements that
                        follow introduce the <code>GetType()</code> method. As the name suggests this method gets the type of the variable
                        supplied. <code>Console.WriteLine</code> then writes these to the console. When run, the program will write the result as shown
                        in the example to the console. For <b>n</b> and <b>x</b> this will be <code>System.Int32</code> and for <b>d</b> and <b>y</b>
                        <code>System.Double</code> where <code>System</code> is a <a href="#Namespaces_and_References">namespace</a>.
                        C# has a number of keywords for commonly used types,  in this case <b>int</b> and <b>double</b> being the keywords for System.Int32 and
                        System.Double (note the capital 'D') respectively . Both can be used in code but in general the keyword is favoured by most.

                    <p><b>Listing 4.2</b> shows examples of the syntax errors that can occur when declaring and assigning variables and that will prevent the application
                        from being compiled. The editor identifies these errors and notifies us by placing a <u class="syntax">red wavy underline</u> under the part of the
                        statement that is causing them. By moving the the mouse over the line a message will popup detailing the error. Some errors can be quite cryptic so
                        following are a few examples and an explanation of what they mean.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>The name 'p' does not exist in the current context</b> - Before a variable can be used it must first be declared either explicitly with
                        the use of a type followed by an identifier <code>int p;</code> or implicitly by use of the <b>var</b> keyword <code>var p = 0;</code></p>

                    <p><b>A local variable or function 'i' is already defined in this scope</b> - Only one unique instance of a variable can exist within a
                        <a href="#Scope">scope</a>. As <code>int i = 1;</code> has already declared variable <b>i</b> the next statement
                        <code>int <u class="syntax">i</u> = 2;</code> is evaluated by the editor as an attempt to declare a second variable <b>i</b> resulting in the error.</p>

                    <p><b>Cannot use variable 'b' before it is declared</b> - C# executes statements in the order they appear in the code from top down. In this case
                        <code><u class="syntax">b</u> = 1;</code> has been written above <code>int b;</code>. Reversing the order of these two statements will resolve this error.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Use of unassigned local variable 'k'</b> - C# requires variables declared within a local <a href="#Scope">scope</a>
                        to be assigned a value before they can be used. Here <code>int k;</code> declares that a variable <b>k</b> of type <b>int</b> but does not
                        assign it a value. When declaring a variable, a value can simultaneously be assigned to it through the used
                        of the <b>=</b> operator as in <code>int k = 1;</code>. Alternatively a variable can be assigned a value after being declared and before
                        being used such as adding <code>k = 1;</code> after <code>int k;</code> and before <code>j = i + <u class="syntax">k</u>;</code> C# also has has the
                        <b>default</b> keyword which allows any variable to be assigned its default value such as <code>int k = default;</code>. In this case <b>k</b>
                        would have a value of 0. Note that it is only variables on the right side of the <b>=</b> operator that need to have a value assigned so the
                        use of the <b>j</b> which is declared but not assigned a value on the left side is valid.</p>

                    <!-- TODO fix this   VVVVV -->


                        <p><b>Cannot implicitly convert type 'double' to 'int'. An explicit conversion exists (Are you missing a cast?)</b> - In all these cases an attempt
                        is being made to assign a variable of type <b>int</b> a value of type <b>double</b>. C# does not allow the assignment of a value to a variable
                        that could unwittingly result in a conversion that produces a loss of information. By assigning a floating point <b>double</b> to an <b>int</b>,
                        the fractional part after the decimal point could be lost. As can be seen from the examples it may not be obvious at first that a conversion is
                        occurring. With <code>i = <u class="syntax">d</u>;</code> an attempt is being made to assign the value in d which was declared a double to i which
                        was declared an int. With <code>i = <u class="syntax">3.0</u>;</code> the variable i which was declared as an int is being assigned the literal 3.0
                        which is interpreted as a double by the editor. With <code>b = <u class="syntax">i + d</u>;</code> as i is an int and d a double the result of
                        i + d is first evaluated by the editor to be a double so assigning this to b produces the error. With <code>b = <u class="syntax">i + x</u>;</code>
                        in the previous statement <code>var x = i + d;</code> again evaluated by the editor to be a double and is allowed to be assigned to x through the
                        use of the <b>var keyword</b>. This results in i + x also being interpreted as a double so assigning it to the int b produces the error. With
                        <code>d = i;</code> there is no possibility of information loss from an int to a double so this is allowed.</p>






                        <p>This is significant as declarations and assignments are most likely made in another part of the code or even someone else's code. With
                        <code>i = <u class="syntax">3.0</u>;</code> the double literal 3.0 is being assigned to the int i. When an int and a double are summed the result
                        will always be a double even if the double value contains With <code>k = <u class="syntax">i + j</u>;</code> the result of int i + double j.
                        Assigning an <b>int</b> value to a <b>double</b> also results in a conversion but is allowed as there is no fractional information to lose. C# has
                        a number of explicit methods that allow for a conversion that results in information loss as will be discussed shortly.</p>

                    <p><b>The left-hand side of an assignment must be a variable, property or indexer</b> - Here <b>pi</b> is a <b>constant</b> and as its value can't be
                        changed this error is the result.</p>

                    <p><b>The expression assigned to 'area' must be constant</b> - As <b>area</b> has been declared a <b>const</b> the use of the variable <b>i</b> in
                        <code>i * 3 * 3</code> produces this error.</p>

                    <p><b>Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'int' and 'bool'</b> - </p>



                    <!-- TODO fix this ^^^^^ -->










                    <p>For built in types C# has a number of different ways conversions can be achieved. A value can be cast by placing the desired
                        type in brackets followed by the variable or literal to be converted. From the examples <code>i = (int)3.9</code> converts the floating point
                        literal <b>3.9</b> is converted to an <b>int</b> with the value being truncated to 3 and assigned to <b>int i</b>.</p>

                    <p>Character literals consists of a single character in a pair of single quotes, <code>'a'</code>.</p>

                    <p>A character consists of one of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Single character</li>
                        <li>Simple escape sequence</li>
                        <li>Unicode escape sequence</li>
                        <li>Hexadecimal escape sequence</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>String literals can be regular or verbatim and/or interpolated. Each can contain zero or more characters enclosed in a
                        pair of double quotes.</p>

                    <p>Regular string literals can contain escaped characters as per above and will be interpreted as such. They can't span
                        multiple lines so to split a statement with a long string literal across two or more lines, each part of the string on each
                        line must first be enclosed in a pair of double quotes. The <code>+</code> concatenation operator is then placed between each string to join
                        them together.</p>

                    <p>Verbatim string literals are prefixed with the verbatim identifier <code>@</code>. Any escaped character will be interpreted
                        verbatim except <code>'\"'</code> which will be interpreted as one double quote. Verbatim string literals can
                        span multiple lines. There must be no white space between the <code>@</code> character and the string.</p>

                    <p>Interpolated strings are prefixed with the interpolation identifier <code>$</code> which indicates that they may contain <i>interpolation
                        expressions</i>. These can contain variables and other special characters that instruct the compiler how to format the string at
                        <span class="nowrap">run-time</span>. Interpolation expressions are wrapped in a pair of curly braces. There must be no white space between the
                        <code>$</code> identifier and the string. To use a curly brace as a character in an interpolated string two braces <code>{{</code> or
                        <code>}}</code> must be used. Interpolation expressions cover a vast range of options information of which can be found in the
<!-- TODO add link below -->
                        Microsoft Reference Documentation</p>

                    <p>The interpolation identifier can be used in conjunction with the verbatim identifier and the order of the identifiers doesn't matter.</p>

                    <p>Following are examples of string usage.</p>

                    <p>An expression is a collection of operands and operators that together can be evaluated and assigned to
                        a variable. If the evaluation is invalid the result won't be assigned and the variable's value will remain
                        unchanged. This may also result in an exception that can end the program. Following are examples of expressions.</p>

                    <h3>Conditional operator ?:</h3>

                    <p>The conditional operator <code>?:</code>, also known as the ternary conditional operator takes the form <code>x = predicate ? a : b</code>.
                        If the predicate is true then the expression returns <b>a</b> else it returns <b>b</b>. Both <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> must be of the same type.
                        The conditional operator can also be used as a shorthand way to replace combined <code>if</code> and
                        <code>else</code> statements. Conditional statements can be nested though doing so can make the code hard to read.</p>
<pre><code>int x = 1;

// y has value 'Yes'
var y = x == 1 ? "Yes" : "No";

// y has value 'No'
var y = x == 2 ? "Yes" : "No";
</code></pre>

                    <h3>Conditional and operator &&</h3>

                    <p>In the expression <code>x = a && b</code> <b>x</b> is true if both <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are true otherwise
                        <b>x</b> is false. If <b>a</b> is false <b>b</b> is not evaluated. This is useful in a situation where, if
                        <b>a</b> is false evaluating <b>b</b> would produce an invalid condition that could result in an exception.</p>

<pre><code>int a = 1;
int b = 1;
int c = 0;

// x has value true
var x = a == 1 && b == 1;

// x has value false
var x = c == 1 && b == 1;

// c != 0 is false so a == b / c is not evaluated
// which prevents a divide by 0 exception
// x has value false
var x != c &gt; 0 && a == b / c;
</code></pre>

                    <h3>Conditional or operator ||</h3>

                    <p>In the expression <code>x = a || b</code>, <b>x</b> is true if either <b>a</b> or <b>b</b> are true otherwise
                        <b>x</b> is false. If <b>a</b> is true <b>b</b> is not evaluated. This is useful in a situation where, if
                        <b>a</b> is true evaluating <b>b</b> would produce an invalid condition that could result in an exception.</p>

<pre><code>int a = 1;
int b = 1;
int c = 0;

// x has value true
var x = a == 1 || b == 0;

// x has value false
var x = c == 1 || c == 1;

// c == 0 is true so a == b / c is not evaluated
// which prevents a divide by 0 exception
// x has value true
var x = c == 0 || a == b / c;
</code></pre>

                    <h3>The null-coalescing operator ??</h3>
                    <p>The null-coalescing operator <code>??</code> returns the left-hand operand if it not null otherwise it evaluates the right-hand
                    expression and returns the result</p>

<pre><code>int? a = null;
// x has value 2
var x = a ?? 2;

int? b = 1;
// y has value 1
var y = b ?? 2;
</code></pre>

                    <h3>The null-coalescing assignment operator ??=</h3>
                        <p>The null-coalescing assignment operator <code>??=</code> evaluates and assigns the-right hand expression to the left-hand variable
                        only if the variable is null</p>

<pre><code>int? a = null;
// a has value 2
a ??= 2;

int? b = 1;
// b has value 1
b ??= 2;
</code></pre>
                    <h3>The Lambda and Expression body definition operator =&gt;</h3>
                    <p>The <code>=&gt;</code> operator has two uses, as part of a <b>Lambda Expression</b> or an <b>Expression-bodied member</b> definition.</p>
<!-- TODO: => add link to anonymous function -->
                    <p>A <b>Lambda expression</b> is comprised of a set of input parameters which are then passed into the body in the form of either an expression or
                        a statement block. They are used to create an Anonymous function. In this case the <code>=&gt;</code> operator is used to separate

                    <p>Arrays and data structures store multiple variables together in ways that allows them to be handled and manipulated more efficiently.</p>
                    <h3>array</h3>
                    <p>An array is like a box with separate compartments in which only one item called an <b>element</b> can be stored in each. They can be single-dimensional,
                        multi-dimensional
                        or jagged and all items must be of the same type. A single-dimensional array is like  one row
                        of compartments. A multidimensional array can contain rows, columns or more up to a maximum of 32 dimensions. A jagged array is like
                        storing a separate box within each compartment of the first where each one could have its own set of dimensions with different sizes. A jagged
                        array is sometimes called an array
                        of arrays. In addition to the examples shown here C# also provides the <b>Array</b> class which provides a set of methods for manipulating
                        arrays, information of which can be found in the <a href="#References">C# reference documentation</a>.</p>
                    <h3>declaring, creating and initializing arrays</h3>
                    <p>An array is immutable which means that the number of dimensions and elements or <b>Length</b> of an array must be defined when the array is
                        created and can't be changed. An array can be recreated by using the new keyword which deletes and replaces the existing array <em>and its data</em>
                        with a new one. There
                        are a number of different ways in which to create an array which can also include initializing the element values. If not initialized the default
                        value for the elements in a single-dimensional or multi-dimensional array will be 0 for numeric types and null for reference types. As a jagged
                        array stores other arrays the default type is always null. Following are examples of how arrays can be initialized.

                    <h3>accessing arrays</h3>

                    <h3>collections</h3>
                    <p>.NET provides a number of data structures grouped under the category of collections. They provide common functionality
                        such as to add, remove and modify either individual elements or a range of elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two main types of collections, generic an non-generic. Generic collections take in a type parameter making them
                        type safe at compile time which allows IntelliSense to indicate syntax errors. Non-generic collections store
                        items as type <b>object</b> which requires casting when accessing the data within them. Because of this non-generic collections are
                        less commonly used today and are mostly found in legacy code.</p>
                    <p>Following is a list of some common collection types but only examples of <b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> and <b>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</b>
                        will be discussed in this article.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> - A collection of items stored by index</li>
                        <li><b>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</b> - Used to store items as key/value pairs</li>
                        <li><b>Queue&lt;T&gt;</b> - Items are accessed first in first out (FIFO)</li>
                        <li><b>Stack&lt;T&gt;</b> - Items are accessed last in first out (LIFO)</li>
                        <li><b>LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</b> - Items are accessed sequentially</li>
                        <li><b>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</b> - Provides notification through events when items are added or removed</li>
                        <li><b>SortedList&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</b> - A sorted collection</li>
                        <li><b>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</b> - A set for mathematical functions</li>
                        <li><b>SortedSet&lt;T&gt;</b> - A sorted set for mathematical functions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>List&lt;T&gt;</h3>
                    <p>A <b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> is a strongly typed generic collection of objects accessed by an <b>int</b> type <b>index</b>. Unlike an array, a list does
                        not have a fixed size and as such does not have to be defined when it is created. It provides a number of useful methods for manipulating its data
                        such as add, remove, sort, find and clear.</p>

                    <p>The keyword <code>enum</code> is used to declare an enumerator which provides a list of named constants. The code
                        editor allows us to use these names to assign the underlying constant values to variables. We can define the type
                        and value of each constant or allow the editor to assign them for us. The default type for the value is an integer
                        and the list is zero based. The following example shows how to declare and use an enumerator using the defaults.</p>
<pre><code>using System;

namespace EnumExample
{
    class Program
    {
        enum Day { Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat }

        // Underlying month type is declared as long
        enum Month : long { Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var day = Day.Tue;
            var dayType = day.GetType();
            var underlyingDayType = Enum.GetUnderlyingType(dayType);
            Console.WriteLine($"Day is {day}, value is {(int)day}," +
                $" Type is {dayType.Name}, underlying type is {underlyingDayType}");

                <article>
                    <p>C# is an Object-oriented programming language (OOP) and objects can be created using reference types such as classes, structures (struct),
                        interfaces and records. Within a C# project these objects can be combined with other resources such as media and text files which are then
                        compiled to create an <b>assembly</b> in the form of either an executable (.exe) or library (.dll) file.</p>

                    <h3>Classes</h3>

                    <p>The main way a C# developer will create an object is through the use of classes. A class is a reference type that is defined using the
                        <code>class</code> keyword and can contain fields, properties, methods, indexers, events, constructors, finalizers and other nested types.
                        Collectively these are called <b>class members</b>. Accessibility to classes from code outside of the assembly and to class members both from
                        outside the assembly and from other objects within the assembly is controlled through the use of access modifier keywords. When no access modifier
                        is applied the default access for a class is <code>internal</code> which means it can only be accessed from within the assembly. For class members
                        the default access is <code>private</code> and only code within the same class can access them.</p>

                    <h4>Fields</h4>

                    <p>A field is a variable or a constant used to store data about an object. A field can be accessed from anywhere within the class.
                        A field's access is normally left as private and access to it is achieved through the use of a property or method.
                        This has the advantage of allowing for data validation and performing other tasks before changing its value. A variable field can also
                        be made readonly through the use of the <code>readonly</code> keyword and can then only be set from within the class
                        constructor when the object is created. A constant field must have its value set when it is declared.</p>

                    <h4>Properties</h4>

                    <p>A property is a way of allowing code external to a class to access its fields. It can use the <code>set</code> keyword to define a
                        <b>setter</b> for writing a value to a field and the <code>get</code> keyword for defining a <b>getter</b> for reading the value from a field.
                        A property can be made read/write by using both <code>set</code> and <code>get</code>, readonly by only using <code>get</code> and write
                        only by only using <code>set</code> though the latter is an extremely rare situation. With <code>set</code> the <code>value</code>
                        keyword is used to hold the value passed in. An alternative to <code>set</code> is <code>init</code> which can only be called by the
                        constructor or an object-initializer. Collectively <code>set</code>, <code>init</code> and <code>get</code> are called <b>accessors</b>. As
                        with all class members, the default access level for a property is private but as the most common use is to access them from outside a class
                        they will usually have an access modifier applied.</p>

                    <p> The default access for accessors is that of the property but can be changed changed through the use of access modifiers provided that</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the property is read/write</li>
                            <li>only one of the accessors has the access modifier applied</li>
                            <li>the access modifier is more restrictive than the property container</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>A property can take two basic forms, manually-implemented and auto-implemented. With a manually-implemented property a separate field known
                        as a backing field must be created. Each accessor must have its own code block with appropriate expressions to read and write to and from
                        the backing field. This has the advantage allowing extra logic to perform other tasks such as validation within the property. With an
                        auto-implemented property accessors are defined without an implementation code block and no backing field is required. During runtime the
                        compiler creates a private backing field that can only be accessed through the property. An advantage of an auto-implemented is that it can
                        be initialized through the declaration like so <code>public int MyProperty { get; set; } = 1;</code>. For a read/write property either both
                        accessors must be manually-implemented or auto-implemented.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Method</h4>

                    <p>A method provides a way of doing things. This could be reading a file, calculating a value, writing to the screen, etc.
                        A method can receive and return values. When not returning a value the return type must use the void keyword.
                        Methods can be overloaded by defining a different number of, or different types of parameters to be passed in. When a method
                        has overloads <b>IntelliSense</b> will show there are more than one version of the method to choose from.</p>

                    <h4>Events</h4>

                    <p>An event is a way for the class to communicate with other objects or other parts within itself that the state of the class instance
                        has changed. The event
                        defines which type of method known as an event handler must be used respond to the event. The event usually passes the
                        object that created the event and an EventArgs that can contain additional information about the event to the event handler. The return
                        type for an event handler is almost always void so if information is to be passed back from the event handler, variables can be included
                        in the EventArgs that can be changed within the event handler.</p>

                    <h4>Indexers</h4>

                    <p>An indexer allows an object to be indexed like an array. It is similar to a property but also takes an index value to
                        set or get a specific instance. In place of an identifier the <code>this</code> keyword is used to define an indexer. The same rules as
                        as those for read/write and accessibility of properties also apply to indexers.</p>

                    <h4>Constructors</h4>

                    <p>A constructor is called when an instance of the class is created and is used to initialize the state of its members.
                        Its syntax is similar to a method but it does not return a value so no return type is to be specified. The name of the the
                        constructor is the same as that of the class. As with methods constructors can be overloaded. If a constructor is not specified
                        the compiler will create a parameterless constructor with an empty code block at runtime with which to create the instance. To create an
                        instance of a class the <code>new</code> keyword is used</p>

                    <h4>Finalizers</h4>

                    <p>A finalizer is used to perform any cleanup of the class when it is no longer in use. The compiler adds a default finalizer to
                        each instance of a class that is created so it would be a rare requirement to add one ourselves.</p>

                    <p>The following example defines a Square class with fields, properties, methods and events. The Program class creates 3
                        instances of the Square class and adds the Square_AreaChanged event handler to the Square_AreaChanged event of both the
                        square2 and square3 instances. After writing the initial area values to the console it then changes the Width property
                        directly on the square2 instance and Height on square3 through the SetHeight method. This triggers the AreaChanged
                        event in each which then calls the Square_AreaChanged event handler which in turn writes the updated values to the console.
                    </p>

<p>The following example defines a string collection which uses an indexer to index instances of itself. The Program class
    creates a new StringCollection instance, assigns the string "Hello World" to the instance at index 0 in the collection, then
    retrieves the same and finally writes its value to the console.

                    <h3>Static classes and static members</h3>

                    <p>So far the majority of the examples we have looked at involve creating an instance of a class by using the <code>new</code> keyword. This
                        allows for multiple instances of a class to be created each with its own initialized state which can be set either by arguments passed in
                        through an instance constructor or with an object-initializer. Creating an instance of a class in this way is known as instantiation.</p>

                    <p>In addition we can make a class static by applying the <code>static</code> keyword to the class definition. Here the class cannot be instantiated.
                        Instead it is
                        created automatically during runtime and only one instance of it exists. As a static class is not assigned an identifier, to access its
                        members the class name is used instead. For a class called <code>MyClass</code> with a method called <code>MyMethod</code> to access the method
                        you would use <code>MyClass.MyMethod</code>.</p>

                    <p>Class members can also be either instance types or made static through use of the <code>static</code> keyword. Note that members within a static
                        class must always be be static whilst members in an instance class can be either instance or static. As with a static class static
                        members are created
                        automatically during runtime and are accessed using the class name.  To initialize a static field a static constructor
                        must be used which cannot have values passed in. Within a class, static
                        members can only access other static members.</p>

                    <p>A static method can be useful when it is to perform simple functions that don't have to store
                        or retrieve data from within the class, for example squaring a number. As the method is created as soon as the program is
                        running it can be shared from multiple locations throughout the programs code without the necessity to create a new class instance every time.
                        The .NET <code>System.Math</code> class which contains numerous small math functions is an example of a static class.</p>

                    <p>It is important to note that whereas each instance of an object carries has its own copy of an instance member static members are shared by all
                        code in an assembly. If a static filed or property's value is changed in one instance of its containing class then the value will be changed
                        for all instances</p>

                    <p>In the following example, <code>InstanceClass</code> contains both instance and static, fields and methods. Whilst <code>InstanceMethod</code> can
                        access both <code>instanceField</code> and <code>staticField</code>, <code>StaticMethod</code> can only access <code>staticField</code>.</p>

                    <p> Next <code>MyClass</code> contains an instance property <code>InstanceProperty</code> and a static property <code>StaticProperty</code>.
                        <code>MyClass</code> also contains methods that can separately set and get the property values. The static property is first set without
                        an instance of <code>MyClass</code> through the use of <code>MyClass.StaticProperty</code>. Next 2 instances of <code>MyClass</code>,
                        <code>myClass1</code> and <code>myClass2</code> are created and when the values of the properties are displayed we see that
                        <code>InstanceProperty</code> has the value 0 and the <code>StaticProperty</code> the value 1. Next <code>myClass1</code> is used to change
                        the value of the instance property to 2 and the static property to 3. When the properties of both instances are again displayed we see that
                        only the instance property in <code>myClass1</code> has changed whereas the the static property in both now has the value 3. This shows us that

                    <h3>Structures (struct)</h3>

                    <p>A <b>structure</b> usually referred to by its keyword <code>struct</code> is similar to a class with the following main differences.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A struct is a value type</li>
                        <li>The static, abstract and sealed modifiers cannot be applied to a struct</li>
                        <li>The readonly modifier can be applied to a struct</li>
                        <li>An instance field or property in a struct can't be initialized when a struct is declared.</li>
                        <li>A constructor in a struct must initialize all instance fields</li>
                        <li>A struct cannot have a parameterless constructor (Note: will be allowed beginning with C# 10.0) </li>
                        <li>A struct cannot have a finalizer</li>
                        <li>A struct can't inherit or be inherited by a another class or struct</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>A struct is normally used to create a basic data type with little or no functionality. Within C# <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>,
                        <code>char</code> and <code>bool</code> are all examples of structs. As a struct is a value type so all instance fields it contains must be
                        assigned
                        a value before it can be used. Although we can't create a parameterless constructor in a struct, the compiler creates one which sets all instance
                        fields to their default values. We can then use this when instantiating a struct with the <code>new</code> keyword. If all instance fields in a
                        struct are accessible then a struct can be instantiated
                        without using the <code>new</code> keyword. For example an integer can be assigned the value 0 either by <code>int x = new();</code> or
                        <code>int x = 0;</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>The following example declares a struct called <code>Box</code> with <code>Width</code>, <code>Height</code> and <code>Depth</code> fields and
                        a method called <code>GetVolume</code>. It demonstrates several ways to declare and assign values to a struct and then writes the values to the
                        console.</p>

                    <h3>Inheritance</h3>

                    <p>Inheritance is one of the main concepts in Object Oriented Programming. It allows us to create a parent class with common features that child
                        classes can inherit and expand upon. In C# a parent class is called a base class and a child a derived class. C# only allows single inheritance,
                        that is a derived class can only inherit from one base class but it does allow for multiple generations which means a base class can be inherited
                        by a second which it turn can inherited by a third and so on. As a result members that are in the base class will be available in each
                        generation of derived classes with the following exceptions.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Static constructors</li>
                        <li>Instance constructors</li>
                        <li>Finalizers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Whilst all other members are available in derived classes their visibility is dependent on the Scope rules. Apart from classes only interfaces can
                        be inherited.</p>

                    <p>The following example demonstrates the syntax for inheriting a class. First base class <code>A</code> is declared as normal. Derived Class
                        <code>B</code> is then declared followed by a colon, then the name of the class to be inherited, followed by the code block for class
                        <code>B</code>.</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace ClassInheritanceExample
{
    // Base class A is fist declared
    class A { }

    // Derived class B inherits class A
    class B : A { }
}
</code></pre>

                    <p>It is important to note that a derived class cannot be made more accessible than a base class. In this next example base class <code>A</code>
                        does not have an
                        accessibility keyword applied so it will be internal by default. When derived public class <code>B</code> then attempts to inherit internal class
                        <code>A</code> this results in a syntax error. Following this base public class <code>C</code> is declared then derived class <code>D</code>
                        inherits class <code>C</code>. Although <code>D</code> is internal by default, this is allowed as <code>D</code> is less accessible that
                        <code>C</code>. Then when public class <code>E</code> inherits <code>D</code> again we have an error as <code>E</code> is more accessible than
                        <code>D</code>.</p>

                    <p>This illustrates that relying on the default accessibility for a class or interface can easily lead to unexpected errors so it is advisable
                        to always use the <code>internal</code> keyword if that is your intention. This is important as the default template provided by Visual Studio
                        does not provide an accessibility keyword so if you see an 'Inconsistent accessibility' error, check that the base class has been declared
                        public.</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace ClassInheritanceExample
{
    // Base class A default accessibility is internal
    class A { }

    // Uncommenting the following results in the error
    // Inconsistent accessibility: base class 'A'
    // is less accessible than class 'C'
    //public class B : A { }

    public class C { }

    // This is OK as internal class D is less
    // accessible than public class C
    class D : C { }

    // Uncommenting the following results in the error
    // Inconsistent accessibility: base class 'D'
    // is less accessible than class 'E'
    //public class E : D { }
}
</code></pre>

                    <p>The following example creates a base class called <code>Animal</code> with a public property <code>Legs</code> that provides access to a private
                        field <code>mLegs;</code>. Both classes <code>Bird</code> and <code>Cat</code> inherit and extend the <code>Animal</code> class with
                        <code>Bird</code> adding the property <code>Wings</code> and <code>Cat</code> the property <code>Meowing</code>. In the <code>Program</code>
                        class an instance of <code>Bird</code> is created setting values for both <code>Legs</code> and <code>Wings</code> and an instance of
                        <code>Cat</code> setting values for both <code>Legs</code> and <code>Meowing</code>. A message describing each is then written to the console with
                        their corresponding properties. The example also shows that attempting to access the private <code>mLegs</code> field in <code>Animals</code> from
                        the derived class <code>Cat</code> results in a syntax error.

                    <p>The implementation of a member in a derived class can overridden provided that the member in the base class is marked with the <code>virtual</code>
                        keyword or has overridden a member in a previous base class. To do so the member in the derived class must be marked with the
                        <code>override</code> keyword. Base class members are not virtual by default and attempting to override a member not marked as virtual results in

                    <p>In the previous example each derived class was created and the methods called separately. Ideally it would have been better to do this
                        all through a loop. We can do this as polymorphism allows us to substitute a parent for a child then when the parent's method is called at runtime
                        it will be substituted for the child's.

                    <p>In this example example a base class <code>LogAnalyser</code> is defined that has a virtual <code>DisplayMessage</code> method. Derived class

                        overriding <code>DisplayMessage</code> with its own implementation. In the <code>Program</code> class a list of type <code>LogAnalyser</code> is
                        created that adds an instance of the base and the two derived classes. A foreach loop then loops through the list using a

<!-- TODO Rewrite this -->
                    <p>Although constructors cannot be inherited those in the base class are still called after the derived constructor is called but before the enclosed
                        code of the derived class constructor is run. Additionally the <code>base</code> keyword can be used in a derived class to call constructors and
                        overridden instance members within the base class. Only those in the immediate base class in the derived class declaration can be accessed. Lastly
                        if a base class is provided with one or more parameterized constructors then the compiler forgoes providing the default parameterless constructor.
                        As a result when inheriting such a class we will then need to provide the derived class with at least one constructor with the same signature as
                        one of the constructors in the base class. The constructor in the derived class must call the constructor in the base class by using the
                        <code>base</code> keyword and pass the arguments provided to it on to the base class constructor.</p>

                    <p>In this example <code>BaseClass</code> has a parameterless constructor that writes to the console when it is called, then sets a value in a
                        a field called <code>mField</code>. It also has a parameterized constructor that takes a value which it uses to set <code>mField</code>
                        and a virtual method <code>GetFieldValue</code> that returns the value of <code>mField</code>. <code>DerivedClass</code> inherits from
                        <code>BaseClass</code>. It too has a parameterless constructor that writes to the console when it is called, then sets a value in its own
                        field called <code>mField</code>. It also has a parameterized constructor which first calls its counterpart in the base class through use of the
                        <code>base</code> keyword which requires passing all arguments it receives to the base class. The derived class also overrides
                        <code>GetFieldValue</code> returning its own <code>mField</code> value and has a method called <code>CallBaseMethod</code> which, using the
                        <code>base</code> keyword, calls <code>GetFieldValue</code> in the base class.</p>

                    <p>In the <code>Program</code> class an instance of <code>DerivedClass</code> is created using the parameterless constructor which results in first
                        the base class then the derived class constructor being called. Then the return value of <code>GetFieldValue</code> followed by
                        <code>CallBaseMethod</code> are written to the console. Next a second instance of <code>DerivedClass</code> is created using the parameterized
                        constructor with the string 'instance 2' passed in and again the return value of <code>GetFieldValue</code> followed by
                        <code>CallBaseMethod</code> are written to the console.</p>

                    <p>The example also declares a class <code>BaseClass2</code> which contains a parameterized constructor. Deriving the class
                        <code>DerivedClass2</code> from <code>BaseClass2</code> without providing a parameterized constructor with the same signature as that of the base
                        class results in a syntax error.

                    <p> An <b>abstract</b> class is used when it makes sense to define a common base class but where the implementation is specific to each derived class.
                        A base
                        class and its members can be declared abstract by marking them with the <code>abstract</code> keyword. It cannot be instantiated so to be used, a
                        derived class must be created that inherits it and overrides all abstract members it contains. Abstract classes can be inherited by sealed,
                        abstract and non abstract classes and can inherit from an abstract or non abstract base class that is not a sealed class. Abstract members cannot
                        declare an implementation and within a derived class are treated the same as a virtual member. Any class that contains an abstract member must be
                        marked with the <code>abstract</code>keyword. An abstract class can contain both abstract and non abstract members.</p>

                    <p>In the following example an abstract class <code>PriceCalculator</code> is declared with an abstract method called <code>CalculateAmount</code>.
                        Two derived classes that inherit from <code>PriceCalculator</code> are declared. The first <code>ItemsPriceCalculator</code> has two properties,
                        <code>ItemPrice</code> and <code>Quantity</code> and overrides <code>CalculateAmount</code> to return an amount by multiplying these two

                        <code>HourlyRate</code>. In this case the overridden <code>CalculateAmount</code> first subtracts <code>StartTime</code> from
                        <code>FinishTime</code> then multiplies thy result by <code>HourlyRate</code> and then returns the amount. Lastly as can be seen, attempting to

                    <h3>Interfaces</h3>

                    <p>"An interface is a contract" has to be one of the worst explanations as to what an interface is, yet it still persists throughout much of the
                        literature you may find on line, including that of Microsoft's own C# reference. So what is an interface.</p>

                    <p>Take a computer manufacturer. They can't anticipate every printer, keyboard, mouse, etc, that will be plugged into their devices. To allow for this,
                        the industry as a whole has created a set of specifications of which various devices must adhere to, so that they are compatible. For a keyboard
                        this may be the signals it must produce when a key is pressed, but it is not the computer manufacturer's job to tell the keyboard manufacturer
                        how to make their keyboards. Providing that the specifications are met the keyboard manufacturer is free to design it as they like. An interface
                        works on a similar basis by defining which members a class or struct will have without saying how they are to be implemented.</p>

                    <p>An interface is created using the <code>interface</code> keyword. The following signature only members can be declared within an interface.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Methods</li>
                        <li>Properties</li>
                        <li>Indexers</li>
                        <li>Events</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Members that are not implemented are public by default and access modifiers cannot be applied to them. Additionally interfaces can contain members
                        that are implemented which is called default implementation. These are</p>

                    <p>An interface cannot contain an instance field or instance auto-property as an interface cannot have an instance state. Note, whilst the declaration
                        of a property in an interface is written with the same syntax as an instance <span class="nowrap">auto-property,</span> it differs in that the
                        compiler does not create an instance backing field. An interface can inherit from and be inherited by another interface. Implemented members in an
                        interface can be overridden. When this is done explicit interface implementation syntax must be used.</p>

                    <p>Whereas a class can only inherit a single base class it can implement multiple interfaces. This is done in the same manner, i.e. the class name is
                        followed by a colon then the name of all interfaces in a comma separated list. If a class also inherits a base class its name must come first in
                        the list. A class can also explicitly implement a member of an interface. Explicitly implemented members and default implemented members in an
                        interface can only be accessed through an instance of the interface.</p>

                    <p>Whilst on the surface an interface may seem to provide much of the same function as an abstract class the important distinction is that a class can
                        contain a state and thus can represent a thing where as an interface cannot and is used to represent a behavior.</p>

                    <p>In the following example the <code>Car</code> class inherits the base class <code>Vehicle</code> and overrides the <code>ApplyBrakes</code>
                        method. The <code>Dog</code> class has a method <code>Speak</code>. Whilst both are quite different objects both are able to move and make a sound
                        and so implement the <code>IMotion</code> and <code>ISound</code> interfaces which respectively include the <code>Move</code> method and
                        <code>Sound</code> property. As can be seen whilst the base class <code>Vehicle</code> must come first in the declaration list, the order of the
                        interface declaration is irrelevant.</p>

                    <h3>References</h3>
                    <p>An application can be made up of multiple sources of code including that which you write. In Visual Studio an application is called a
                        <b>Solution</b> and can be viewed in the <b>Solution Explorer</b> window which can be accessed via the <b>Solution Explorer</b> tab
                        on the right side of the application.  If the tab is not visible, click on <b>View</b> then <b>Solution Explorer</b> in the menu. Here you
                        will see the name of your solution and the projects contained within it. Under each project are code files which can be arranged in folders
                         along with . These can contain Frameworks such as the current
                        .Net 5.0, applications and libraries.  called projects which together form an application
                        solution. To use such code a reference to it must be added.
                        In <b>Visual Studio</b> this is done through the <b>Solution Explorer</b>  Under each project you will find any folders and files associated
                         with it and also a node called <b>Dependencies</b>. Expanding the Dependencies node will reveal several more nodes. If any references have
                         been added a node will be present called Projects under which you will find the referenced code. To add a reference right click on any











                         The Frameworks node
                         contains the frameworks that have been added by Visual Studio when the solution was created. For a console application created with a
                         .Net 5.0 target framework. Expanding the Framework node reveals that this is called Microsoft.NETCore.APP and expanding this node reveals
                         the libraries that are included by default.

                    <h3>Namespaces</h3>
                    <p>C# requires that each object within a particular scope be unique and namespaces do this by organizing the code into a tree structure
                        similar to that of the file system on a computer. For example in order to have 2 files called MyFile.txt on a computer you may put one
                        in a folder called RootFolder\MyFiles1 and the other in RootFolder\MyFiles2. Namespaces are the same except that the root namespace is
                        normally the name of a project and the backslashes are replaced with a dot. A sublevel namespace is known as a nested namespace</p>

                    <h3>namespace</h3>
                    <p>The <code>namespace</code> keyword followed by a code block is used to declare objects belonging to a particular <b>namespace</b>. Objects can then
                        be identified in code by using their <b>fully qualified</b> names in the form <code>MyNamespace.MyObject</code>. <b>IntelliSense</b> uses
                        namespaces to assist you by providing suggestions as you type. After typing the root namespace then pressing <kbd>.</kbd>, all the objects and
                        nested namespaces within it
                        will appear
                        in the suggestion box. If one of the nested namespaces is selected, the <kbd>.</kbd> can again be pressed to find all objects and nested namespaces
                        within it and the process can be repeated until no nested namespaces remain.</p>

<pre><code>// A using directive can be placed at
at the top of the file
namespace MyProject
{
    class SomeClass  { }

    enum SomeEnum { sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat }

    interface ISomeInterFace { }
}

// Declare an object in a sublevel namespace
namespace MyProject.DataModels
{
    class Person { }

    class Employer { }

    class Job { }
}

// An alternate way to declare in a
// sublevel using a nested namespace
namespace MyProject
{
    namespace Animals
    {
        class Dog { }

        class Cat { }
    }
}

namespace AnotherNamespace
{
    class AnotherClass
    {
        public void Example()
        {
            // Objects identified by using their
            // fully qualified names
            MyProject.MyClass myClass = new();
            MyProject.MyEnum myEnum = MyProject.MyEnum.Mon;
            MyProject.Animals.Cat cat = new();
            MyProject.DataModels.Person person = new();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

                    <p>When adding a new class using the default class template, Visual Studio automatically puts it within a namespace based on the folder in
                        the project in which the class is added. If you want to use the root namespace instead and want to avoid editing the namespace, add the
                        new class to the root project then move the file to your desired folder. The following shows the code generated by adding a class called
                        <b>MainViewModel</b> to a folder called <b>ViewModels</b> in a project called <b>MyCompany</b>.
                    </p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace MyCompany.ViewModels
{
    class MainViewModel
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <h3>using</h3>

                    <p>Identifying every object by its <b>fully qualified</b> name soon becomes cumbersome and can make the code hard to read. The <code>using</code>
                        directive makes all objects and nested namespaces within a namespace available for use. This is also known as importing. The name of just
                        the objects name can then be used within the code.</p>
                    <p>If you know the name of the object you want to add to your code but don't know its namespace, Visual Studio provides a shortcut for this.
                        After typing the object's full name and with the cursor touching it, for example <code>List</code>, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>
                        and IntelliSense will suggest the correct using directive to use, most likely at the top of the list. Click on the suggestion and it will
                        added to the code. Please note that the full name name must be entered with the correct case. Also, the project must have a reference
                        to the library containing object. (See below)</p>
                    <p>To remove unused <b>using</b> directives, right click anywhere in the code editor and click <b>Remove and Sort Usings</b>.</p>
                    <p> The following assumes that the first example in this section already exists.</p>

    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <h3>Aliases</h3>

                    <p>The <code>using</code> can also be used to create an alias for a namespace or object. The following assumes that the first example in this
                        section already exists.</p>

                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <p>Scope is the accessibility of a variable from one part of the code to another. In C# scope is arranged like the layers of an onion. Variables in an
                        outer scope can be accessed from those within but not vise versa. In computer science this is known as encapsulation and inner scopes that are
                        contained within outer scopes are said to be nested.
                        </p>
<!-- TODO variable links-->
                    <p>A <b>local variable</b> is a variable declared in a method, property or indexer or one of its nested code blocks. The variable is only accessible
                        after it has been declared and only within the same code block or a nested code block. A local variable within the same block or a nested code
                        block cannot be declared with the same name. A parameter that is passed into a method or indexer is accessible outside the member and becomes a
                        local variable within the member.</p>

                    <p>A variable declared inside a class, struct or record type but outside any member is called a field and is also a member of that type. A field can
                        be directly accessed by any of the type's methods, properties or indexers and any nested code blocks they contain, irrespective of the location of
                        the field's declaration within the class. By convention fields are normally declared at the top of a class before any other code. A field can be
                        modified to be readonly and its accessibility level can be changed with the use of an access modifier, (See Access modifiers below).</p>

                    <p>A local variable in the same container (enclosing type) as a field can be declared with the same name and any type. When this is done the field is
                        said to be hidden by the local variable. In this case, to then access the field the <code>this</code> name qualifier this must be used. For
                        example if in a class a field <code>int someName</code> exists and in a method <code>string someName;</code> to access the field you would use
                        <code>var x = this.someName</code>.</p>

                    <p>Following are examples of scope.</p>

                    <h3>Access modifiers</h3>
                    <p> Accessibility level defines where a type or type's members can be used by other code within your assembly or other assemblies.
                        Each type or member has a default access level which, depending on the context, can be changed either by the access level of the
                        container or by the use of an access modifier keyword. A local variable's
                        accessibility is always restricted to the scope in which it is contained and cannot be modified. Except for <code>protected internal</code>
                        and <code>private protected</code> only one access modifier keyword can be applied to a type or a member. For information about accessibility
                        of the accessors for a property or indexer see Classes.
                        Following is the list of access modifier keywords and the access level provided by them.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>public</b> - the same assembly or another assembly that references it</li>
                        <li><b>protected internal</b> - the same assembly or in a derived class in another assembly</li>
                        <li><b>protected</b> - the same class or a derived class in the same or another assembly</li>
                        <li><b>internal</b> - the same assembly only</li>
                        <li><b>private protected</b> - the same class or a derived class in the same assembly only</li>
                        <li><b>private</b> - the same class or a derived class nested within a base class only</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Types declared directly within a namespace (i.e. not nested), can only be declared public or internal where internal is the default level. The
                        following types can be be declared in a namespace <code>class</code>, <code>struct</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>delegate</code>,
                        <code>record</code> and <code>enum</code>.</p>

                    <p>The following list shows containing types, which access modifiers can be applied to the members and nested types within them and their
                        default access level.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>class or record</b> - <code>public</code>, <code>protected internal</code>, <code>protected</code>,
                            <code>internal</code>, <code>private protected</code>, <code>private(default)</code></li>
                        <li><b>interface</b> - <code>public (default)</code>, <code>protected internal</code>, <code>protected</code>,
                            <code>internal</code>, <code>private protected</code>, <code>private</code>*</li>
                        <li><b>struct</b> - <code>public</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>private(default)</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Enum members do not have any declared accessibility. An enum member's accessibility  is determined by the accessibility of the
                        enum type container and access modifiers cannot be applied to them.</p>

                    <p>The following example demonstrates various accessibility scenarios. </p>

                <a class="back-to-top" href="#">Back to top</a>
                <article>

                    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm used extensively throughout C#. It encompasses a number of
                        concepts that provide the developer a structured process for writing a program. This is particularly important for large
                        applications that may be maintained by multiple teams of developers. Instead of having one massive
                        length of code that does everything, it is instead broken down into objects that each have a narrowly defined responsibility.
                        C# uses a sort of template in the form of either a Class or Struct to define an object and each specific object is known as a type.
                        These are then combined to create an application.
                    </p>

                    <p> Major principles of OOP include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Object</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation</li>
                        <li>Inheritance</li>
                        <li>Abstraction</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Object</h3>

                    <p>An object combines data and methods to represent everyday things such as a number, a spreadsheet, a person or
                        even something less tangible such as the relationship between a part's name and its quantity in a database. During runtime multiple objects
                        based on the same type can be created each with its own own internal state. This allows different versions (instances) of an object to exist. For
                        example two number type objects could be created, one with a value of 5 and another with 7. Three techniques employed by C# to define an
                        object are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Properties - a particular state of an object such as color, the number of columns, what a thing is made of.</li>
                        <li>Methods - something an object can do such as add numbers, manipulate text, etc. Methods can take in and return modified data.</li>
                        <li>Events - a way of communicating to other objects that its state has changed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Take for example a light. It could have a 'Light Is On' property, a 'Turn Light On' method and a 'Light Has Turned' On event. A person object
                        could then check the 'Light Is On' property and if it's off (false), use the 'Turn Light On' method to turn the light on. The method would then
                        set 'Light Is On' to true and then trigger the 'Light Has Turned On' event. A second person object could be watching out for the event and when
                        it happens it would know to run its own 'Read Book' method.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>

                    <p>Encapsulation protects the data and methods used to define the internal state of an object from direct manipulation.
                        This way code external to an object need not be concerned with the data it contains or how a method works, only that by using it, it will provide
                        the expected result. Take for example the posting of a letter. Provided that you give it the correct address and a stamp, once you place it in
                        the mail box you expect it to arrive at the recipient. You need not be concerned with the details of the method (how it will be delivered) or
                        the internal data (the name of the person doing the delivery). With this the creator of the object is free to change the internal workings of
                        an object without affecting those using it, as long as it continues to do what it says on the box. In order to decide which object members are
                        made available externally to an object, C# provides access modifier keywords such as <code>public</code> and <code>private</code>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Inheritance</h3>

                    <p>Many things in life have similarities. For example a car and a motorbike both have an engine, wheels and brakes but where as a motorbike has
                        handle bars a car has a steering wheel. This makes it difficult to use one object to represent both but rather than create two objects duplicating
                        much of the same functionality we can use the concept of inheritance. Here, first an parent object containing all the common traits is created
                        then separate child objects based on the parent are created, each adding just their own differences. Using the previous example we
                        could create a vehicle object that has the engine, brakes and wheels properties then from that create a motorbike object that adds handle bars
                        and a car object that adds a steering wheel. By having a common inherited wheels property the number of wheels can be set at runtime to 2
                        for a motorbike and 4 for car or even 3 if it is a three-wheeler.</p>

                    <p>Other names for parent are ancestor or superclass and for child, descendant or subclass. Just to be different, C# calls a parent a
                        base class and a child a derived class which is specifically mentioned here as C# provides the <code>base</code> keyword to access
                        a base class from a derived class. Also note that structs can neither inherit or be inherited by another class or struct.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Abstraction</h3>

                    <p>Abstraction is the process of determining and extracting from a complex problem just the information we require to define a solution. For example
                        what does it take to eat food. Here we need to ask an expert in this case lets consider what a child would say. They'd probably say something
                        like, you  put food in your mouth chew it then swallow. That's it. Now of course the human body is an extremely complex organism, to actually
                        eat food the brain has to send signals to the jaw muscles to chew the food, then to the tongue to swallow it. From there it goes into the stomach
                        where it is mixed with acid, then into the small intestine ... But for the purposes of survival all the user has to be concerned with is
                        food, mouth, chew, swallow. Of course had we omitted the chew step then the choke method may have kicked in resulting in a premature end to our
                        program. It is important then to extract exactly what is required, no less, no more and this is an essential design step before the first line
                        of code is even written.</p>

                    <p>Another term you may come across is abstraction layers which is the dividing of a problem into the various layers of complexity. Take for instance
                        what is involved in writing and running an application. As mentioned in the C Sharp Language section all a computer knows is ones and zeroes but
                        even that is not the lowest level. If we go further we get down to the quantum level where the state of electrons are controlled by transistors.
                        This is the hardware abstraction layer limited mainly to the manufacturer. Above the ones and zeroes, or binary abstraction layer, is the assembly
                        language which is a set of instructions in a pseudo human language provided by hardware manufacturers as to what the hardware does. This is
                        the language used by by those creating the compiler that translates the C# language we write into the binary language amd ultimately into the
                        quantum state of the hardware. This does not mean that someone writing in C# is completely separated from the other layers. For example as you
                        use the code editor the the compiler is constantly interpreting what you write and if it can't, it will warn you that there is a syntax
                        error.</p>

                    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
<!-- TODO Rewrite -->
                    <p>Polymorphism is the ability to substitute any child object for its parent and the members they contain. Using the inheritance example, we want to
                        make sure that we can steer our vehicle so we provide a steer method. This presents a problem as we can't be sure whether the consumer is going
                        to buy a car or a motorbike. The car has a steering wheel property that has to be set whereas the motor bike has handle bars. Polymorphism allows
                        us to substitute what the steer method does in the child object. If we then have a purchasing object, that has a buy method that can take in
                        a vehicle object and when it is called, we can substitute the vehicle parent object for either car or motorbike child object. This way whichever
                        is provided will have the correct steer method.
